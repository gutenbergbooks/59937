<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p class='noindent'>Any reader familiar with the figure of the gallant and
unfortunate Louis de Frotté will realise why neither
he nor the Normandy which he led so well play any
part in these pages—not indeed that he has served as
prototype for any character in them, but because to
have introduced him also would have been to overblacken
the reputation of Bonaparte. Yet that
which is here laid to the First Consul’s charge is no
libel, for the deeds done at Alençon and Verneuil in
mid-February, 1800, are written in history.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span></p>

<h2 id='b1c1'>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>“WHAT IS MIRABEL?”</h3>

<p class='noindent'>“I wish I had been taught how to make a bed!” complained
Roland de Céligny, as he wrestled with his blanket
in the half-darkness of the attic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may think yourself lucky to have a bed to make!”
retorted a comrade who sat cross-legged on a neighbouring
pile of sacking. “Mine cannot be ‘made,’ though a
careless movement will reduce it to its component elements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil! If I tuck in the blanket this side, it won’t
reach to the other!” pursued the young grumbler, fiercely
demonstrating the truth of his accusation, where he knelt
by a mattress placed directly on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From this, my paladin, learn that the gifts of Fate
are evenly distributed,” returned he of the pile of sacking.
Since one of his arms was in a sling, it is possible that he
would not have been capable even of the Vicomte de
Céligny’s unfruitful exertions, but he did not say so. On
the contrary, he looked at his friend’s performance with
the air of one who in a moment will say, “Let me do it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you would only take less——” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Heaven’s sake be quiet, you two!” entreated a
third voice. “One cannot count, much less think, in
your chatter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Two tierce-majors.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The owner of this voice, a man of about forty-five or
fifty, sat at a table in a corner playing piquet by candlelight
with another. There is no reason why you should
not play piquet, even if you are a Chouan officer in the
late April of the year of grace 1799—or, if you prefer it,
which in that case is unlikely, Floréal of the year VII
of the Republic—and are concealed at the top of an old
house at Hennebont in Brittany with a bandage on your
head, and an ache within it which may well justify a little
impatience to noise. When, in addition, your partner
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
refuses to play for money, the game becomes so harmless as
almost to be meritorious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the appeal of the piquet-player—his superior officer
into the bargain—the wounded critic on the sacking made
no reply save a grimace. The time selected for bedmaking
by the very good-looking young man who was engaged in
it was not, as might be guessed, a morning hour; it was, on
the contrary, nine o’clock in the evening. Two candles
stuck in the necks of bottles gave the card-players their
requisite illumination; another, standing on a dilapidated
chest of drawers, shone on the book which a third young
man, sitting astride a chair, had propped on its back and
in which he appeared to be immersed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attic thus meagrely lit was spacious, and full of
odd corners, but crowded with tables and chairs and
cupboards, for it was the top floor of a furniture dealer,
where he stored his old or unfashionable goods, many
of which had been piled up on the top of each other to
make more room, and where two or three huge old wardrobes,
jutting out like dark shadowy rocks from the
walls, still further reduced the space available for occupation.
Yet though it was, patently, a refuge, it was also a
rendezvous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this spring of 1799 the Directory, the cruel and
incapable, was still prolonging its dishonoured existence,
and after ten years of torment the French people were still
enslaved—to an oligarchy instead of to a monarchy. The
liberty dangled so long before their eyes, the liberty in
whose name so many terrible crimes had been committed,
seemed further away than ever. Inert and exhausted,
pining under a leprosy of political corruption, her credit
and trade almost ruined, the mere ghost of what she
had been, France was sighing for the master that she was
impotent to give herself, the man who should overturn
her new tyrants and raise her up once more to her full
stature. And to most minds in the West, that home of
loyalty, only one master was conceivable, and that was
Louis XVIII., the King who had never reigned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the West, moreover, at this moment, the Chouannerie,
that sporadic guerrilla warfare of profoundly Royalist
and Catholic stamp, indigenous to Brittany, Anjou, and
Maine since the overthrow of the great Vendean effort
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
in 1793, was showing signs of reviving—under persecution.
It had indeed been temporarily stamped out at the pacification
of three years ago, but that pacification had left the
Royalists of Brittany and the neighbouring departments
in a position which gradually proved to be intolerable.
They were not at war, yet they lived in continual peril,
not one of them sure of his liberty or even of his life.
After the scandalous <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> of Fructidor, ’97, the
promised religious freedom was not even a name, and
political freedom, especially in the western departments
whose elections had been so cynically annulled, was a
mere farce. It came, in fact, at last to this, that the
Minister of Police could recommend that the Royalists
of those regions should be “caused to disappear” if necessary;
tyranny unashamed had replaced oppression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally enough, in 1798 the Chouan began to make
his appearance once more. At first he merely robbed
couriers and diligences of public money. But this not
very creditable activity was on the surface; underneath,
in the hands usually of gentlemen, the work went secretly
forward of organising that indomitable and tenacious
peasantry, at once pious and cruel, and of transforming
brigandage into real war; and so, throughout the West,
might be found wandering Royalist leaders with their
little staffs, striving to keep effective the Chouans who
had once fought, and to enrol and arm fresh volunteers.
To such a band, commanded by the Marquis de Kersaint,
an <span class='it'>émigré</span> distinguished in Austrian service who had not
long come over from England, belonged these five men
in the furniture-dealer’s attic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were not, at this moment, in very enviable case,
for besides that two of them were wounded, they and their
handful of peasants—since scattered—had yesterday
come off second best in an unexpected collision with
Government troops in the neighbouring department of
Finistère, and they were now beginning, moreover, to be
anxious about the safety of their leader, who, with a
guide, had taken a more circuitous route to Hennebont
in order to gather certain information. And his presence
here was urgent because it had long been arranged that
he and his two elder subordinates should meet and confer
in Hennebont with Georges Cadoudal, the famous peasant
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
leader of the Morbihan, concerning the better organisation
of the wilder and more westerly region of Finistère, which,
it was whispered, M. de Kersaint was eventually to command
in its entirety. Yesterday’s misfortune had made
such a meeting more, not less, necessary; and so here,
half-fugitive, M. de Kersaint’s officers were, having had
the luck to slip unobserved into the little town in the
dusk. But now there were rumours of a <span class='it'>colonne mobile</span>
on the road which their leader would probably take; and
in any case there was always danger—danger which
the three young men who formed a sort of bodyguard of
aides-de-camp to him considered would have been lessened
for him had they shared his odyssey. But M. de Kersaint
had apparently thought otherwise.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The game of cards in the corner came at last to an end,
and the opponents added up their scores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have won, Comte,” said the bandaged player’s
adversary, leaning back in his chair. The candle-light
which threw up his companion’s somewhat harsh features
shone in his case on a nondescript round face with no
salient characteristics. By this and by his peasant’s
attire he might well have been a small farmer; but on
the other, him addressed as “Comte,” the gaily embroidered
Breton vest and short coat sat less naturally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose I have,” returned the latter. He
drew out his watch and frowned. “They ought really
to be here by now,” he observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt if it is quite dark enough outside,” replied his
late adversary. “Le Blé-aux-Champs would hardly
risk bringing M. de Kersaint into Hennebont while light
remained.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish he had not gone to Scaër,” muttered the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not think that anything has happened to
M. le Marquis, do you, sir?” asked Roland de Céligny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied M. de Kersaint’s second-in-command.
“I will not believe in misfortune; it is the way to bring
it about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps this is they,” suggested Artamène de la Vergne,
the youth with his arm in a sling, as a step was heard
on the echoing stairs. And even the silent reader lifted
his head from his book to listen.
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But the moment of suspense which followed was not
lightened when the door opened and old M. Charlot, the
furniture-dealer, himself appeared on the threshold,
candle in hand, tinted spectacles on nose. In a silence of
expectancy he came in and shut the door carefully behind
him, while five pairs of eyes stared at him uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen,” he began in a cautious voice, looking
round on the forms ensconced among his shadowy furniture,
“is not one of you a priest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second piquet-player bent forward. “Yes, I am,”
he surprisingly admitted. “Do you want me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is an old lady very ill next door, Monsieur l’Abbé,
an old Mlle Magny, who has been a respected inhabitant
of this town for many years. It is not that she wants a
confessor or the Last Sacraments, because she had them
two or three days ago; it is that to-night she is wandering
so much that her niece, who looks after her, came in to me
about it just now in great distress. The old lady seems
to have something on her mind, and Mme Leclerc thought
that if she could get a priest, an <span class='it'>insermenté</span>, of course——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé who looked so little of an Abbé interrupted.
“I am quite ready to go to her, Monsieur Charlot, if it is
necessary, but I should have thought that, rather than
summon a stranger, the poor lady’s relatives would have had
recourse to the priest who confessed her the other day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mon père,” replied the old man, “but you see he
lives very retired outside the town since Fructidor, and
there is always a certain risk for him in coming, and seeing
that you were on the spot, and not known here for a
priest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word “risk” appeared to have decided the question,
for at it the Abbé in the peasant’s dress had risen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will come at once,” he said without more ado, and
walked round an intervening barrier of upturned chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is very good of your reverence,” said M.
Charlot in a tone of relief, moving towards the door.
“She has been an excellent Christian in her time, that poor
lady, and shrewd enough too, but now she lies there,
so her niece says, talking continually of some place—or
person, maybe—called Mirabel, and of a wedding. And
nothing——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mirabel!</span>” ejaculated the Abbé, stopping short.
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, Monsieur l’Abbé!” exclaimed M. Charlot, struck
by his tone, “if you know something about this Mirabel,
then surely the good God has sent you to the poor soul!
I will take you there at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened the door for the priest, who went through it
without another word. None of the three young men,
all watching these two protagonists, noticed that the
wounded piquet-player also had risen abruptly from his
seat at the mention of the name which had so affected
his companion, had stared after them a second or two,
and that he now let himself fall into his chair again with a
despondent gesture, and took his bandaged head between
his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now the Abbé’s got a job to occupy him,” said Artamène
de la Vergne in a sleepy voice. “I wish I had;
or that M. de Kersaint and Le Blé-aux-Champs would arrive
quickly, so that I could go to sleep without the prospect
of being waked up again immediately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The true campaigner can sleep at any time, and for
any length of time,” remarked Roland complacently. “It
is early yet, at least I think so. My watch has
stopped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And mine is lost,” responded the Chevalier de la
Vergne. “Lucien is sure to have his, and it is sure to be
correct. Ask him the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucien!” said Roland. No answer from the reader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucien, deaf adder!” supplemented Artamène.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe he is asleep,” muttered the Vicomte de
Céligny, and by a snake-like elongation of body and arm
he contrived to reach a leg of the student’s chair and to
shake the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish <span class='it'>you</span> were asleep!” exclaimed his victim, lifting
a mildly exasperated face. “What in Heaven’s name
do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The time, dear friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucien du Boisfossé pulled the watch from his fob.
“A quarter—no, seventeen minutes past nine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you reading?” demanded Artamène.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>Æneid</span> of Virgil,” replied Lucien, his eyes on the
page again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The questioner gave an exclamation, almost of horror.
“Ye gods! He is reading Latin—for amusement!”
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“A quarter past nine,” remarked Roland reflectively.
“This time yesterday I was——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t chatter so, Roland le preux! You disturb our
Latinist .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and also,” added Artamène in a lower tone,
“run the risk of breaking into M. de Brencourt’s meditations.
Look at him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bandaged piquet-player, who still sat by the table,
seemed indeed sunk in a profound abstraction, letting the
idle cards fall one by one from his fingers. It was plain that
he did not know what he was doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wager he is thinking of a woman,” whispered Artamène,
bringing himself nearer to his friend. “It seems a
quieting occupation; suppose we think of one too! But
on whom shall I fix my thoughts .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you,
Roland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slight flush, invisible in the poor light, dyed young
de Céligny’s cheek as he answered, with a suspicion of
embarrassment, “I will think of that poor old lady next
door. Will the Abbé exorcise her, do you think, from the
spell of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what was it—Mirabel? And, by the way,
what is Mirabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The name of a kind of plum, ignoramus,” replied
Lucien du Boisfossé unexpectedly. He yawned as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plainly our Lucien has been studying the Georgics
also,” commented Artamène.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An encyclopaedia would be more to the point!”
retorted Roland. And raising his voice, he said, “Comte,
what is Mirabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older man heard, even with a little start. He laid
down the cards and came out of his reverie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mirabel, gentlemen, is the name of a property and
château near Paris, the château that was begun for François
I. You may have heard of it. It belongs, or belonged,
to the Duc de Trélan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trélan,” observed the young Chevalier de la Vergne
reflectively. “I seem to remember the name in connection
with the prison massacres in September, ’92. He
was killed in them, I think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied the Comte de Brencourt sombrely. “He
was never in prison. He had emigrated. It was his wife
who was butchered—with Mme de Lamballe.”
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morbleu!” exclaimed Artamène. “And the Duc is
still alive, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe so,” replied M. de Brencourt, even more
sombrely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he now?” asked Roland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somewhere abroad—in England or Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worse than being dead!” observed Artamène, lying
down and pulling the covering over him.
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span></p>

<h2 id='b1c2'>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE GIFT IS OFFERED</h3>

<p class='noindent'>And next door, in a tidy but overcrowded bedroom, the
Abbé Chassin, without any of the marks of his office, sat
and listened to the babbling of an old spinster lady who
was to terminate an uneventful and singularly respectable
life as the messenger of destiny to not a few people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heavy curtains were pulled back from the side of
the small fourposter by which the priest sat, and the
candlelight fell soft and steady on the old, old blanched
face within the neat capfrill, itself scarcely whiter than the
visage it surrounded. On the waxlike countenance, amid
all the signs of nearing death, was the imprint of that
masterfulness which sometimes descends with age upon a
certain type of old lady. And Mlle Magny was talking,
talking continuously and pitifully, her eyes fixed, her
shrivelled fingers pleating and plucking the edge of the
sheet in the last fatal restlessness. Those hands were the
only things that moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to have had it ready .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I did not know
in time, I did not know! All these years to have had it
in the family, and not to have known that it was there!
But perhaps I shall be in time after all—they cannot have
come back from the chapel yet, surely. But I must be
quick, I must be quick! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and when the bride gives
round the sword-knots and the fans to all the fine company
I shall offer my gift to the young Duc. But I must be
quick .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the withered hands, abandoning the sheet, began to
fumble over the bed as if searching for something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé bent forward and laid one of his own gently
on the nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cannot I help you, my daughter—cannot I do something
for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes turned a moment; the brain, deeply absorbed
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
in the past though it was, seemed to grasp this intrusion
from the present, even to the pastoral mode of address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a priest, Monsieur? That is good—that is
good! Yes, you can open this casket for me,” and she
made as if she held it. “And inside you will find the
wedding gift for the young Duc de Trélan—but you must
be quick, quick! They will be back from the chapel!
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah, I cannot find the key—I cannot turn the lock!
My God, if I should be too late after all! Mon père, mon
père, help me! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But, mon père, you are doing nothing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé looked round in desperation. He could see
nothing that at all resembled a locked casket among the
little treasures of the old lady’s room, the pincushions,
the images of devotion, all the prim collection of a
blameless lifetime. But in a moment the struggle with
the imaginary lock came to an end, and as the tired hands
relaxed a smile crept about Mlle Magny’s indrawn mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How handsome he is, Monseigneur Gaston!” she said
in a tone of admiration. “My dear lady will be proud of
him to-day! They will dance to-night after the wedding,
and I shall see it all, as my lady wishes. But none of the
fine ladies there will have given the bride such a gift as
I shall give the bridegroom, though I am only his dear
mother’s maid.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But why does the Abbé not bring
it to me? When the bride gives round the swordknots
and the fans——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” gently interrupted the priest, “if you will
tell me where your gift is, I will bring it to you instantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look of cunning swept over the dying old woman’s face,
and a faint sound that was like a chuckle came from her
lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, no, I have hidden it well!” she replied unexpectedly,
“hidden it nearly as securely as the treasure of
Mirabel itself. You will not find it in a hurry, Clotilde!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who was Clotilde, wondered the priest? The niece
with whom she lived, probably. But what was this
about a ‘treasure’ in Mirabel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To think,” went on the old voice musingly, “that
the precious paper was all these years in Cousin François’
dining-room, and all those scores of years before that,
since the time it was stolen. And all the dead and gone
Duchesses might have had the rubies to wear. I might
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
have clasped the necklace round my sainted lady’s own
neck. Now the new Duchesse will be the first to put it
round her pretty throat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest gave a little shiver. Still that wedding
eight-and-twenty years ago! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Since then the pretty
throat of which she spoke had known a very different
necklace .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but of the same colour .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if you have hidden the rubies, Madame,” he
hazarded, bewildered between the ‘treasure’ and the
‘paper,’ the ‘gift’ and what was concealed, “you will
not be able to give them to the bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not I who hid them!” responded Mlle Magny
impatiently. “It was the first Duc, in the days of Mazarin,
who hid a great store of money and jewels at Mirabel.
And no one was ever able to find them again. Stolen
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hidden .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hidden .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. stolen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they make a
beautiful couple, and when Monseigneur de Paris has
married them and the nuptial mass is finished.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long pause. Then the old lady whispering, “Sainte
Vierge, how tired I am!” clasped her hands on her breast.
The Abbé got up and bent over her. Her eyes were
closed, and he heard her murmur indistinctly, “<span class='it'>Mater
amabilis, virgo prudentissima</span>, grant me soon to see my
sainted lady!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be on the brink of so important, so long-lost a secret—too
late for it to be of use .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yet, after all, perhaps,
not too late—and to be baffled at the very moment of
discovery! When such an extraordinary coincidence
had brought him, of all men in the world, to this bedside,
for its possessor to take the secret unrevealed out of life
with her! It was hard!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, as M. Chassin was a priest, he put away regret,
and tried to think only of the needs of this soul about to
pass through the great door. Mlle Magny had had the
last rites, that he knew. Was the moment come for the
commendatory prayer? He slipped his fingers round
her wrist. But the pulse, though feeble and irregular, was
not at the last flutter. And slowly, as if his touch had
roused her, the old lady opened her eyes again. The
look in them was different; meeting it, the priest knew
that she was no longer wandering in the mists of nearly
thirty years ago. She was back in the present; so much
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
so, indeed, that she was capable of astonishment at seeing
this unknown man in peasant’s dress bending over her—more,
of resenting it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you, Monsieur, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what
are you doing here?” she demanded, in a tone which,
if scarcely more than the frailest of whispers, yet conveyed
some of that masterfulness which was written on her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a priest, Madame, an <span class='it'>insermenté</span>, and M. Charlot,
your neighbour, brought me here, at your niece’s desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clotilde always .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. takes too much upon herself,”
said the thread of a voice in a tone of displeasure. “I have
already had .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Last Sacraments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Madame,” assented M. Chassin, realising that
Mlle Magny’s recovery of her senses was not advancing
him much. “It was not for the purpose of administering
you that I came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her look asked him what his purpose was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, my daughter, you were speaking of—Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” retorted Mlle Magny quite sharply. “I
am not in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the habit of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. discussing my past
life with strangers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been ill, Madame,” said the priest gently.
“And has not Mirabel something to do with your
present life too?” Then, being a man who knew how to
wait, he took his seat beside her again, and exercised this
power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I been wandering?” asked the dying woman,
suddenly turning her eyes upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been very ill .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they tell me I shall not
get better.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Is that so, Father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is what I have been given to understand, my
daughter. But you have made your peace with God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said she. “But there is something else that I
desire to do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. before I die .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yet God knows how I
am to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest bent forward. “God does indeed know,
my daughter, and it was doubtless He Who sent me here
to-day. You wish, do you not, to give into the hands
of the Duc de Trélan a paper now in your possession
concerning a treasure which has been for many years
hidden in his château of Mirabel.”
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A flush rose in the ivory face. “I talked of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of that—and of a wedding at Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mlle Magny put a trembling hand over her eyes. “Indeed,
you must forgive me! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All these years I cannot
forget it—the lights, the jewels, the beauty of that couple,
my lady’s happiness. For I was tirewoman, mon père,
during many years, to the Duchesse Eléonore, the Dowager
Duchess, a saint on earth. God rest her soul! She only
lived for a short time after her son’s marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest nodded, as one who knows already. “I, too,
have cause to say ‘God rest her!’—And the paper you
spoke of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What paper?” demanded the old voice, suddenly
suspicious again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The paper containing the secret of the hoard hidden
at Mirabel in Mazarin’s time, which has come into your
hands, Madame, and which you were wishing that you
could have given to the Duc de Trélan on his wedding
day so many years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence from the bed. “Well,” said the
old lady at last, with more animation, “if I told you
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I may as well tell you the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And slowly, with pauses for breath, she told him how
the Duc de Trélan of Mazarin’s day, implicated in the
rebellion of the Fronde, and not knowing which party would
finally triumph in that kaleidoscope of civil conflict,
buried gold and jewels in his once-royal château of Mirabel
and made a memorandum of the hiding-place for his
son, then away fighting with Condé. The Duc himself
had to flee before Mazarin’s vengeance and died in exile;
Mirabel was for a space confiscated, and when the next
Duc was reinstated the treasure could not be found. The
memorandum of its hiding-place had been stolen by the
late Duc’s steward, who offered to sell it for a large sum
to the successor to the title. Suspecting a hoax the latter
refused; yet, as was not difficult for a great noble in those
days, he procured a <span class='it'>lettre de cachet</span> against the offender,
who dragged out the rest of his life in prison. Before his
arrest, however, he had placed the memorandum in the
hands of a friend; but the friend never took any steps
to utilise it, and merely preserved it in such a manner
that it was to all intents and purposes lost—for he pasted
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
the parchment, face downwards, against the back of his
wife’s portrait. Probably, said the old lady, he was
waiting till the man who had confided it to him came out
of prison; but this the steward never did, and a short
time before his death in captivity his friend, Mlle Magny’s
great-great-grandfather, died too. And there, gummed
against the picture of the flourishing bourgeoise dame of
Louis XIII.’s day, the parchment had remained for nearly
a hundred and fifty years, till, some two years ago, on
Cousin François’ death, the portrait had come into Mlle
Magny’s possession, and the old lady herself, in examining
it, had lighted on the parchment, and realised of what
irony Fate was capable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, if only I had had it earlier!” she concluded
wistfully. “What a gift to have made my sainted lady,
who was sometimes pressed for money for her charities,
since, like all the Saint-Chamans, both her husband and
her son spent their means royally. And now these two years
that I have had it it is useless! Where is the Duc de
Trélan now? Alas, we know where his wife, the
Duchesse Valentine, went! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And what is Mirabel
to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Madame,” said the priest, as the voice ceased
exhausted, “two years ago you could have done nothing.
But to-day, as Heaven has so ordered it, you can give
that paper to the Duc de Trélan, if you wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned her sunken eyes on him again. The lustre
was already fading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how is that, if you please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I am .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in close touch with the Duc. If
you commit the paper to me he shall have it before—before
I am many days older.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—if he is still alive—he is an émigré .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has been
an émigré for many years!” objected Mlle Magny incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless I am in close touch with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The failing eyes of the sick woman searched his face—that
commonplace visage out of which looked neither
good nor evil. It was difficult to read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have nothing but your word for that,” she said,
while suspicion and a wistful desire to trust him strove
together in look and tone.
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest put his hand into a pocket of his embroidered
vest and pulled out an ornate rosary of ebony and silver.
Taking one of the silver paternoster beads between his
finger and thumb; he bent over Mlle Magny and held it
near her eyes. “Can you see what is engraved on that
bead, Madame? It is not a sacred emblem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady put up her feeble hand and tried to push
his a little further off. “You are holding it too near,
mon père,” she said irritably. “I am not so blind as
that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It looks like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is very worn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yet it
looks like a bird of some kind, with wings outspread.
What is that doing on a chaplet? Is it on the rest of the
beads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He showed her. “Victor, Cardinal de Trélan, in the
early days of the century, seems to have had a strange
fancy for his family crest on his rosary. There is his
monogram on one bead. That bird, Madame, is the
Trélan phoenix, and the present Duc gave me this old
rosary at my ordination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly she seized his hand. “The Trélan phoenix!
Let me look again! Yes, it is, it is! Ah, to see it once
more after all these years!” And as the priest relinquished
the chaplet, the Duchesse Eléonore’s tirewoman,
almost sobbing, put it to her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé waited, and after a moment she turned on
him moist eyes and said, puzzled, “But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
seem to remember .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ordination .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Cardinal’s
rosary .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was surely to the young Duc’s foster-brother,
a Breton peasant, whom I never saw .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that it was
given .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when he took orders?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember quite rightly, Madame. And I am
that foster-brother, that Breton peasant, Pierre Chassin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had he suddenly revealed himself as Louis XVIII. or
the Comte d’Artois the devoted old spinster could scarcely
have shown more emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God be praised! God be praised for this mercy!”
she quavered. “His foster-brother! Yes, I remember
hearing from my lady all about your mother. Six years
before I entered her service it was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—Remembering then, Madame, what I too owe to
your lady of blessed memory, and to the Duc, who, as
you probably know, had me educated and gave me a cure
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
on his estates in the south, you may trust me, may you
not, with the document?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed!” returned the old lady, and there
was no shadow of doubt in her tone now. But the shock
of joy, her devotion to the great family with whom her
life had been bound up, and the advent of this man who,
if he were not himself the rose, was almost a graft from the
tree—all these seemed to have benumbed her faculties,
for she lay quiet, tears of weakness and happiness stealing
from under the closed lids. Presently she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is in France again then, the Duc?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid I cannot tell you that, my daughter.
But, on the faith of a Christian and a priest he shall have
the secret in his hands very shortly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will not be able to make use of it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who knows? And if not now, when happier days
come, perhaps. If he can make use of it, it will be of
immeasurably greater service to him to-day than it would
ever have been a quarter of a century ago. For this
much I can tell you, Madame, that, wherever he is, he is
fighting for the King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a Trélan should!” she murmured with a smile.
But the smile had gone when she added, “And the terrible
fate of his wife, the Duchesse Valentine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It broke his heart,” said the priest briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lady was spared much,” murmured Mlle Magny.
She passed a shaking hand over her eyes. “So much
blood .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Mirabel deserted.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Are the candles
going out, mon père, or is it my eyes? N’importe—you
can still find the parchment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that little closed frame
by the mirror yonder. If you open it you will know the
face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did. It was a little pastel drawing of the Duchesse
Eléonore, his patroness, wearing the widow’s weeds in
which he best recalled her. He came back to the bed
holding it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was to have been buried with me, that little picture
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it still shall be. Clotilde knew how fond I was of it—but
she would never have guessed anything else, poor
fool .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I took a lesson from my forbear .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Tear off
the paper at the back, mon père.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Chassin obeyed, and as he peeled off the pinkish,
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
speckly paper recently pasted there, a piece of yellow
parchment doubled up against the real back of the picture
was disclosed. It was folded in four, and on it was written
in brownish ink the single word, “Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open it!” said the voice from the bed, grown very
weak now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest obeyed. As he unfolded the parchment
with no very steady hands, his eyes were greeted with a
sort of rough sketch-map of some complexity, underneath
which was written, in a crabbed seventeenth century
hand:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plan de l’endroit dans mon chasteau de Mirabel où
j’ay fait enterrer plusieurs milliers de pistoles et divers
parements de pierreries de feu ma femme, à cause
des troubles sévissant en ce royaume.” And he caught
sight of “Item, 10 sacs contenant chascun 2,500 pistoles
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Item, un collier de rubis des Indes fort bien
travaillé .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Item, une coupe en or ciselé dite de la reyne
Margueritte” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole was inscribed “Pour mon fils hault et puissant
seigneur Gui de Saint-Chamans, Marquis de la Ganache,
Vicomte de Saint-Chamans,” and signed, “Fait par moy
a mon dit chasteau de Mirabel ce six avril de l’an mil six
cent cinquante-deux, Antoine-Louis de Saint-Chamans,
Duc de Treslan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is indeed——” began the priest as soon as he
could find voice, when, glancing off the parchment, he saw
the change which, in the brief space of his study of the
document, had come over the face on the pillow. Mlle
Magny had used her last reserve of strength over this
matter; it was gone now, and she was going too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Promise me, Father!” she gasped out as he bent
over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise you, my daughter, as I hope myself for
salvation!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drawn lips smiled. “I can say my <span class='it'>Nunc Dimittis</span>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bless me, Pierre Chassin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his hand. “<span class='it'>Benedicat te</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” and
passed straight on to the “Go forth, O Christian
soul .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the end she was unconscious, and a quarter of an
hour later, the weeping Clotilde on one side of the bed
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
and the proscribed priest praying on the other, Mlle
Magny, her last thoughts on earth occupied with the
house of Trélan, went through the great door to meet her
sainted lady, leaving on its hither side the secret of Mirabel
to bring about results undreamt of.
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span></p>

<h2 id='b1c3'>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE GIFT IS RECEIVED</h3>

<p class='noindent'>All this while the occupants of M. Charlot’s attic, which
the Abbé had so abruptly quitted, were taken up with
their own anxieties, and though they had at last fallen
silent, the chiaroscuro of their abode was fairly throbbing
with uneasiness. What made their leader, with a guide
above suspicion, so late in finding his way from Scaër?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, just about the moment that M. Chassin, next
door, had finished the <span class='it'>Proficiscere</span> and was calling for
“Clotilde,” the Vicomte de Céligny exclaimed, not for
the first time, “This must be they!” The four men strained
their ears, for a noise could certainly be heard on the
staircase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dame! it sounds as though Le Blé-aux-Champs were
drunk!” observed Artamène.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or hurt!” added the Comte de Brencourt, listening
uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heavy, shuffling footsteps which they had heard
ascending the stairs paused outside the door. Roland
sprang up and opened it, drawing back instantly with a
little cry. Two men, both in Breton costume, stood on
the threshold, the elder and taller supporting the other, a
young saturnine-looking peasant, whose face was sulky
with pain, and whose unshod left foot was enveloped in a
stained and muddy handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur le Marquis!” cried Roland and Artamène
together, “What has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing very serious,” replied the elder newcomer
cheerfully. “We startled a <span class='it'>colonne mobile</span> in the dusk,
that is all, and our poor Blé-aux-Champs has a ball through
his foot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you yourself are unhurt, de Kersaint, I hope?”
asked the Comte de Brencourt, not without anxiety, as he
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
came forward from his corner. “We were getting very
uneasy about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am untouched, thank you. But this lad of mine——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him lie down on my mattress, sir,” suggested the
Vicomte de Céligny, and, as it happened to be the nearest
to the door, the young Chouan, after vain protests, hobbled
towards it, his arm still round his leader’s neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, lie down, mon gars,” said M. de Kersaint, lowering
him to the pallet, “and we will see what can be done
for this foot.” He looked round. “Where is our surgeon-in-chief,
the Abbé?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confessing or otherwise ministering to a dying woman
next door,” replied M. de Brencourt. “M. Charlot came
in for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis de Kersaint raised his eyebrows a trifle,
but made no comment. “I am afraid that we are somewhat
of an infirmary here altogether,” he remarked.
“What of your injuries, Comte—and yours, La Vergne?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not deny that I have a headache,” returned M. de
Brencourt. “But, as for the cause, the Abbé dressed the
scratch this afternoon, and reported that it was doing
excellently. My wrist” he showed a bandage “will, he
says, take a little longer to heal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your safe arrival, Monsieur le Marquis, has done
even more for my arm than the Abbé’s ministrations,”
said Artamène.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint smiled at him and shook his head, as he
knelt down by the prostrate guide and began to take
the handkerchief off his foot. He would have been more
or less than human if he had not known that he was idolised,
as well as feared, by these well-born young followers of
his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me do that, Monsieur le Marquis!” now begged
Roland, while the thoughtful Lucien produced from the
recesses of the attic a bowl of water and some torn linen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Marquis de Kersaint, asking Roland when he had
ever dressed a gunshot wound, went through the process
with a deftness which suggested that he himself had dressed
not a few. The young peasant, who had lain with his
face hidden in the pillow, caught his hand as he finished
and carried it dumbly to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, mon gars,” said his leader kindly, as he withdrew
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
it. “Lie there and be as comfortable as you can
under the circumstances. The ball has gone clean through,
which is a great mercy. Roland, put a covering of some
kind over him.—Thank you, Lucien; yes, I should like
some fresh water. You can put it on that convenient
chest of drawers yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he stood there, washing the blood off his hands,
it was not difficult to understand the attraction that the
Marquis de Kersaint might possess for either sex or any
age. As a young man he must have been superlatively
handsome, and now the grey at his temples only served to
emphasize his appearance of extreme distinction. Just
as his dark, slightly rippling hair gained by contrast with
that touch of Time’s powder, so the peasant’s dress which
he wore merely set off the natural air of command that
hung about him—an air of which it was plainly impossible
for him to divest himself, even for purposes of disguise.
It was innate in the whole poise of his tall figure, in the
aquiline nose with its delicate nostrils, in the imperious
glance of the fine grey eyes. Yet there was a measure of
geniality about the mouth—of the kind that it is not wise
to presume upon. Everybody in the attic knew that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my children, and what have you been doing since
you arrived?” he asked, looking round as he dried his
hands. “Lucien, I see, has got hold of a book as usual.
What have you been reading, Lucien?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is what he has been reading, Monsieur le Marquis!”
cried the young Chevalier de la Vergne, snatching
up du Boisfossé’s Virgil whence he had laid it, face downwards,
on his chair. And holding the book with the hand
which rested in the sling, of which he still had the use,
he flourished his other arm at Roland, who was standing
near, and began to declaim at him the famous lament
out of the sixth book for the untimely dead Marcellus—</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>“Heu miserande puer! si qua fata aspera rumpas,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'> Tu Marcellus eris. Manibus date lilia plenis</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'> Purpureos——”</span></p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He had got no further when, to his enormous surprise,
the book was gently but firmly taken out of his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not repeat those lines, boy, over anyone young,
as you are doing at this moment,” said M. de Kersaint
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
quietly looking, not at him, but at Roland. “I always
think they are unlucky.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And before the two young men had time to recover from
their astonishment he had walked over to the other side
of the attic, and joined his second in command at the little
table to which the latter had returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have some papers here, de Brencourt,” he said,
sitting down, “which we could look at till the Abbé returns.
Undoubtedly our attempt was premature .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but unless
we can get money it always will be premature. I have
seen ‘Sincère’; he could join us with at least two hundred
and fifty men if we could only provide arms for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always the same cry—insufficient arms and ammunition,”
remarked his lieutenant rather bitterly. “How is
anything considerable going to be done in Finistère if there
is always this lack? And we could get both in plenty
from England if we only had the money to buy them
with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” said the Marquis. “But where the money
is to come from I do not know—beyond the not very
generous subsidy which the British Government has
promised me for the summer.—Well, we must take counsel
with Georges when he comes. Now, look at these figures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he and the Comte de Brencourt were still bending
over the papers which he had spread out on the table
when the three young men, who had withdrawn themselves
as far as possible from the conclave of their superiors,
became aware that the priest was once more in their
midst. He had entered among the shadows very quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A la bonne heure, Monsieur l’Abbé!” said Roland
de Céligny. “Monsieur le Marquis has arrived.” And
he indicated the other side of the attic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have you been to the wedding at Mirabel?”
enquired Artamène mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé Chassin quickly turned on him with a frown,
putting his finger to his lips. But he was too late; the
words were out, and, though the culprit had moderated
his voice, they had been heard. And Artamène, roused at
once to interest and alertness by the priest’s gesture, was
somehow aware of a sudden stiffening of M. de Kersaint’s
whole figure, ere he said, turning round from the table,
“What is this about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mirabel?”
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé seeming in no great haste to answer, it was
M. de Brencourt who replied, “The old lady whom the
Abbé has been visiting next door is, apparently, suffering
from delusions about Mirabel—that château of the Duc
de Trélan’s near Paris. That is what M. de la Vergne
means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is interesting,” observed the Marquis de Kersaint,
turning further round to look at the little priest, who had
not advanced a step since Artamène’s jest. “And did you
learn anything fresh about Mirabel, Abbé?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I did, Monsieur le Marquis,” answered the priest
rather shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May we hear it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Chassin was silent, and seemed to be considering this
request. Artamène saw his face, and it was oddly perturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are not, I hope, inviting you to reveal the secrets
of the confessional?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why may we not hear it, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” said the Abbé gravely, “it is more suited
for your private ear, Monsieur le Marquis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked M. de Brencourt, instantly, looking
from one to the other, “why for M. de Kersaint’s private
ear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This question the Abbé seemed totally unable to answer,
and after a second or two the Marquis de Kersaint said
carelessly to his subordinate, “Because M. Chassin knows
that I am a kinsman of the Duc de Trélan’s, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A kinsman of the Duc de Trélan’s—you!” exclaimed
the Comte de Brencourt in obvious surprise. “A near
kinsman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, very distant,” replied his leader quickly.
“And that is why I cannot conceive how a disclosure
affecting his property can possibly be destined for my ear
alone. So let us all hear it, if you please, Monsieur l’Abbé.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt, still under the empire of surprise or
some other emotion, continued to look at this kinsman of
M. de Trélan’s very fixedly; so, from where he still stood
near the door, did the priest. A better light would have
revealed entreaty in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Monsieur l’Abbé, I am waiting!” said the
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
Marquis de Kersaint rather haughtily, and in the fashion
of a man who has never been used to that discipline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé set his lips obstinately. “It will keep well
enough till to-morrow, Monsieur le Marquis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, a communication from the dying? And who
knows whether we shall all see to-morrow? Come, Abbé,
I command you!—Roland, a chair here for M. Chassin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether the priest could have stood out, had he willed,
against that masterful voice and gesture, at any rate he
did not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, Marquis,” said he, and Artamène, thrilled
to the core, thought, “ ‘Tu l’as voulu, Georges Dandin!’
That’s what he would really like to say, our Abbé!”
And since their leader had intimated that the matter was
not private after all, he applied himself to listen with all
his ears. Roland, looking rather troubled, set a chair at
the table for the priest and stood back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must know then, Monsieur le Marquis,” began the
Abbé in a low voice, “that the old lady whom I have been
visiting had been present at the festivities in 1771, when
the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the young Duc de Trélan married his bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That beautiful and most unfortunate lady!” commented
M. de Brencourt under his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis glanced at him for the fraction of a second,
and the priest went on, nervously rubbing his hands together,
and rather pale:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems that there is a legend of a treasure hidden in
Mirabel since the days of the Fronde, a treasure whose
whereabouts no one has ever been able to discover. Since
you are a kinsman of M. de Trélan’s, Monsieur le Marquis,
it is possible that you have heard of the legend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint nodded thoughtfully. “I believe I have
heard of it. Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The story appears to be true. The document describing
the hiding-place of the treasure was stolen at the time—nearly
a hundred and fifty years ago—and came into the
possession of this old lady’s family, but in such a way
that it was only recently rediscovered by the old lady
herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an extraordinary tale! Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since then she had desired to give it to the Duc, but
could not, as he was not in France. And in her delirium
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
just now, fancying herself back at the wedding, she was
talking so persistently of offering to the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the young
couple, as a wedding gift, this paper, which would help
them to what was after all their own, that M.
Charlot——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wedding gift for de Trélan and his wife!” interposed
the Comte de Brencourt with a laugh. “Bon Dieu, what
irony, considering how their wedded life ended!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely that need not concern us now, Monsieur de
Brencourt!” said his leader coldly. “Go on please,
Abbé.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the most curious coincidence,” pursued M. Chassin,
his eyes fixed on the Marquis, “M. Charlot asked me, as a
priest, to see if I could not set the old lady’s mind at rest
by some means. She did at last regain control of her
senses, and I was able in the end to assure her that I could
and would despatch the document, if she entrusted me
with it, to the proper quarter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she gave it you?” asked the Marquis, bending
forward with some eagerness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it here now,” answered the priest, touching his
breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint drew back again, and Artamène was
struck with his resemblance to a chess player who is
meditating the next move. But only the Marquis de
Kersaint himself and the man whom he had forced into
playing out this gambit with him, fully realised the awkward
position into which his insistence had got them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I must make it my business to despatch it, somehow,
to M. le Duc,” finished the Abbé. “It was of course my
knowledge that you were kin to him, Monsieur le Marquis,
which made me accept the trust, as I knew I could rely on
your assistance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Marquis was looking down at the table and
said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The document will hardly be of much use to M. de
Trélan when he does get it,” remarked the Comte de Brencourt.
“Mirabel, I have heard, is now a museum or something
of the sort; at any rate it is in government hands.
And M. de Trélan—where is M. de Trélan? In England
still? No, hardly. One never hears of him. Perhaps
he is dead.”
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he is alive,” replied his kinsman briefly, lifting his
eyes for a second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! But how is he going to profit by this treasure,
even if it is still there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless, I must fulfil my trust,” observed M.
Chassin, looking across the table at M. de Kersaint’s
lowered head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, undoubtedly, Abbé, though I do not know how
you are going to do it even with M. de Kersaint’s
cousinly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is it cousinly? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. assistance. What do
you yourself think of the problem, Marquis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis de Kersaint raised his head. “I think,”
he said slowly, looking hard at M. Chassin, “that the Abbé
is right. M. de Trélan must be informed, somehow. But
at the same time, since it is practically out of the question
for him, in exile, to take any steps in the matter—and
would be difficult and dangerous even were he in France—and
since our need for money is so pressing at this
moment, I would propose——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” asked the Comte.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To ask, as his kinsman, for his authorisation to use
the treasure, if we can come at it, for the needs of Finistère—that
is to say, for the King’s service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O sir, do you think we could!” cried Roland eagerly,
starting forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, Monsieur le Marquis, send us to Mirabel!” cried
Artamène.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going too fast, gentlemen. We must first get
the Duc’s leave to pillage his property, even though it be
confiscated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think you will have difficulty in getting it?”
asked the Comte de Brencourt, narrowing his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I do not think so. As you have yourself pointed
out, Comte, how is M. de Trélan going to profit, in any
case, by this suddenly revealed hoard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, when the King comes into his own again, it
would be of no small service to the Duc, a fund in his own
château! I expect his financial resources, great as they
once were, are much embarrassed. He could hardly have
been accused of husbanding them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to know a great deal about the private
affairs of M. de Trélan, Comte!” observed M. de Kersaint
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
drily, turning and looking at him. “I might observe
that no honest man has gained by the Revolution, and that
those with much to lose have lost proportionately. However,
if my kinsman takes the view that you suggest—which
I do not think he will—he must be induced to look
upon our present proposed use of the money as a loan to
His Majesty. After all, it was never of any advantage to
him as long as he was unaware of its existence or of its
whereabouts, and of these, apparently, he never would
have known but for the extraordinary coincidence of
which the Abbé has just told us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” suggested M. de Brencourt, “before approaching
him on the subject—through you—might it not be as well
to get a sight of this precious document, so that we may
form some idea as to whether the amount will repay the
risking a man’s neck to find, and whether it will prove
easy to come at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest and M. de Kersaint looked at one another.
“Yes. I think we might do that without indiscretion,”
said the latter, after a moment’s hesitation. “Do not you,
Abbé?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Chassin made no reply in words, but drew out from
his coat the parchment received from the dying woman
and gave it into the hands of his leader. The Marquis de
Kersaint spread out the ancient memorandum on the
table, moved the candles in their bottles nearer, and the
three men studied in silence the rough diagram and its
legend. Nor were Roland and Artamène, in the background,
innocent of craning their necks to see likewise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten bags—two thousand five hundred pistoles in
each,” murmured the Comte reflectively. “How much is
that, I wonder, in modern money? And there are jewels
too, apparently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis de Kersaint’s lips were compressed, his
face an enigma. “It certainly appears to be worth taking
risks for,” he said at last. “Money is what we most need
in the world now for Finistère. We can get the men; the
last few months have shown me that clearly, but of what
use are unarmed men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Less than none,” observed his second in command.
“This document, therefore, seems singularly like a gift
from heaven.”
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall certainly communicate with M. de Trélan without
delay,” said the Marquis. “May I keep this parchment,
Abbé?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had hoped that you would charge yourself with its
despatch, Monsieur le Marquis,” replied the priest, and
M. de Kersaint without more ado folded it up and put it
in his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me, de Kersaint,” said the Comte de Brencourt
reflectively, playing with the cards which still
strewed the table, “that, considering all things, the exceptional
circumstances, our pressing needs, the possibility
that you may never succeed in communicating with the
Duc—wherever he may be—that we could hardly be
blamed if we took the law into our own hands, and did not
wait for his authorisation. After all, the risk would be ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That solution had already occurred to me, I admit,”
said the Marquis, with the ghost of a smile, while mute
applause from MM. de Céligny and de la Vergne greeted
the Comte’s suggestion. “But the affair is in a sense the
Abbé’s, and entrusted to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am quite content to abide by your decision, Monsieur
le Marquis,” replied the priest sedately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, de Kersaint,” objected the Comte, evidently
struck by a sudden idea, “have you not some reversionary
interest in the treasure yourself, if you are kin to M. de
Trélan? Should we not ultimately be robbing you,
perhaps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am not sufficiently nearly related to the Duc for
that,” returned the Marquis quickly. “I am connected
with him by marriage only—a distant kinsman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you will allow me to congratulate you on
that, then,” said M. de Brencourt in a sombre tone. “For
myself, I should not care to think that I had near ties of
blood with a man who, in safety himself, left his wife to
perish as he did!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An electric shock seemed at these words to communicate
itself to the other two men. M. de Kersaint’s right hand,
which rested on the table in the ring of candlelight, was
seen instantly to clench itself. The next instant the Abbé,
by a sudden clumsy movement, sent the candle nearest to
him to the floor where, with a crash of the bottle, it was
immediately extinguished.
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, Monsieur le Comte!” he interposed
quickly, bending forward. “—Dear me, how awkward I
am!—Pardon me, but you do the Duc de Trélan a great
injustice, surely! How could he, an émigré to whom
France was closed, possibly rescue a woman immured in
a Paris prison? The thing is preposterous. Besides, he
probably knew nothing about her being there till all was
over. I have heard that Mirabel was not sacked till August
the thirtieth, and the prison massacres, you will remember,
began on the second of September.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem very much the champion of M. de Trélan,
Abbé!” remarked the Comte, looking at him hard.
“You have wasted a candle over him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One should try, surely, to be just to those who cannot
answer for themselves,” retorted the priest. “Moreover, I
am certain M. de Kersaint would bear me out in what I
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He does not seem to be in any great haste to do so,”
observed the other, half to himself, and his eyes suddenly
moved to the clenched hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am too much amazed at your attack on my kinsman,”
retorted the Marquis, in a voice unlike his own. “It is
incredible that such a thing should be said in France of
M. de Trélan—that he could have saved his wife and did
not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte shrugged his shoulders. “I do not know
that it is what others say, for I imagine that few people
trouble their heads about de Trélan now-a-days. But it is
what I think—though as a matter of fact you are putting
more into my words than I actually uttered. Perhaps
I am prejudiced. I knew that lady many years ago,”
he went on, with lowered eyes, fidgeting with the cards
again, “the most gracious of God’s creatures, and to
remember that she went, abandoned by everybody, through
<span class='it'>that</span> door, saw, as her last glimpse of life, those obscene
faces, that gutter running with blood, that mound
of——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest jumped up and seized him by the arm.
“For God’s sake, stop, Monsieur de Brencourt!” he
whispered. “Do you not know that most of M. de Kersaint’s
family perished in the massacres!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at that the Comte did stop. After a moment
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
M. de Kersaint removed the hand with which he had
covered his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should indeed be glad if you would spare me that
subject,” he said, in a scarcely audible voice, not looking
at either of them. Even the one remaining candle showed
him to be frightfully pale. “I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I cannot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps
we should finish this discussion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the morning. It
is already very late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is very late,” agreed the Comte, plainly rather
horrified. He leant over the table. “Can you forgive me,
Marquis? Of course I was not aware, and I regret——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew that,” said M. de Kersaint with a palpable
effort, and touched the hand which the other held out.
And so ended the reception of Mlle Magny’s wedding gift.
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span></p>

<h2 id='b1c4'>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>A VERY YOUNG MAN</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Roland de Celigny, waking with a start, wondered for
a moment where he was. Then he raised himself on his
elbow and looked about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dawn was slipping a slim, cool hand into the strangely
populated attic, and the grey light invested furniture and
sleepers alike with quite a different appearance from last
night’s. Roland himself had insisted on giving up his
pallet permanently to Le Blé-aux-Champs, because of his
hurt, and had ensconced himself at the other side of the
attic. Over in his old place Chouan and noble, alike young
and alike wounded, lay side by side, the only difference in
their condition being that the peasant, for all his protests,
had the better couch. But, like M. de Brencourt, huddled
on the little sofa of worn, gilt-striped rose brocade, and the
Abbé, of whom he could see only the feet projecting round
a wardrobe, they both appeared to be asleep, despite
their injuries; and Roland knew that Artamène’s gave him
no slight pain at times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he could not be altogether sorry for his friend’s
wound. For, since it was M. de la Vergne’s right arm
that had suffered, it had fallen to the Vicomte de Céligny
to write at his dictation a line of reassurance to his mother
and sister in Finistère. And thus Roland’s own fingers
had formed, if his brain had not originated, the words
which would undoubtedly have the happiness of penetrating
into the little ears of Mlle Marthe de la Vergne, even,
probably, that of being read by her brilliant dark eyes.
And she would know, too, from the contents of the letter
who had penned it. The question whether she would care
was one which he did not like to press overmuch, for he
had very little to go upon, poor Roland, since Marthe
had grown up—one meeting under the eyes of Mme
de la Vergne in the wide, cool salon of the château with its
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
shining floor, and Mlle Marthe rising from tambour work
at its farther end; and one brief message of good wishes
with which his friend Artamène, her fortunate brother,
was found to be charged when Roland met him a few weeks
ago at the rallying-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland could have wished that his friend’s flesh wound
were his own, that he also had something with a tinge of
suffering and heroism about it, of which Mlle Marthe could
have been informed, to which she might even have given
a moment’s regret. Or, better still, if it could have been,
that the injury had happened so near the Château de la
Vergne as to leave no alternative but to take the sufferer
in and tend him there. Alas, Roland neither possessed
the requisite damage, nor had the Château de la Vergne
the desired proximity to the scene of the little defeat at la
Croix-Fendue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides, if anything untoward happened to him, he was
under promise to return, if possible, to his grandfather,
with whom he lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland did not remember his mother, and of his father,
though he had died only about a year and a half ago, he
had seen extremely little. Three years after Mme de Céligny’s
death he had been committed, a child of five years
old, to the care of his maternal grandfather, the Baron de
Carné, and by him he had been brought up at Kerlidec,
in Brittany, separated by the breadth of France from his
patrimony near Avignon. He had seldom visited this, or
his morose parent, though when he did, M. de Céligny had
always made a point of initiating him, young as he was,
into the management of the estate which would one day
be his—for the Vicomte, unlike so many landowners in
those troubled years, had never been dispossessed. But
Roland was much fonder of the stern and passionate old
man who had brought him up, and who had for him such
exquisite tendernesses; and he had become too much
accustomed to living with a grandfather rather than with
a father to find the arrangement surprising. He had,
moreover, few friends of his own age to comment on its
unusual character, since his education had been entirely
conducted at Kerlidec by his grandfather and a tutor or
two. Artamène de la Vergne, who lived at no very great
distance, was, in fact, his only intimate.
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet in the end, through no fault of the Vicomte de
Céligny’s other than an unfortunate choice of the moment
of his death, his estates did not come to Roland at all.
He died very suddenly of heart disease just after the coup
d’état of ’97, and the Directory at once seized the property
on the specious pretext that the heir was an émigré. Because
the events of Fructidor had revived the legislation
against that unfortunate class, it had taken a year and a
half and very cautious moves indeed on the part of the
Baron de Carné even to get his grandson’s name removed
from that inauspicious list on which, like many another,
it wrongly figured, and Roland was not yet in possession
of his inheritance. His present proceedings, if the Government
became aware of them, were still less likely to hasten
that event.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And these proceedings had been entered into against
M. de Carné’s wishes; another had overborne that strong
will of his. To this day Roland could not quite understand
how it had been done. For a moment he lived again
through the episode of his quasi-abduction from Kerlidec
last February;—that strained interview (at part of which
he had been present) between his grandfather and the tall,
commanding visitor who, turning out, to Roland’s surprise
and delight, to be the Marquis de Kersaint, the hero of the
lost day of Rivoli, enlisting likely young men to fight for
the King later on in Finistère, had asked M. de Carné if
Roland might come with him——provided Roland himself
were willing. Of Roland’s willingness—rather, rapture—there
could be no question, but M. de Kersaint had insisted
on the Baron’s formal consent; and this, on the understanding
that Roland was to be regarded strictly as a loan,
and returned, had been given .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but given with such
palpable, almost venomous hostility that the youth
could not imagine why it should have been vouchsafed
at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The end of the episode, too, just because it puzzled him,
was bitten into his memory. Grandfather and grandson
were on the perron watching the unbidden guest ride away
down the dripping avenue—for Roland was to join him,
with Artamène, a few days later—and Roland, boylike,
had exclaimed at his admirable seat on a horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you say, Roland, a damnably good seat!” M. de
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
Carné had returned harshly. “A damnable air of assurance
altogether! Quite enough to turn a young man’s
head, or for that matter a——” He checked himself, and
said with bitterness that they must begin to think of
Roland’s preparations. And when the young man remorsefully
replied, “Not yet, grandpère! It is growing dark;
let us think of our game of chess!” his grandfather retorted,
looking at him in a way that he could not fathom, “Chess!
Poor little pawn, you have been taken!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if it were so, the pawn certainly had no objection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, indeed, feeling a sense of elation, almost of
importance, at being apparently the only one awake in
this company, Roland looked past the intervening furniture
towards the two large chairs in which M. de Kersaint had
elected to spend the night. Well, he was still stretched
in them, long and rather shadowy in outline, but Roland
doubted if he were asleep, for as he gazed at him he heard
the Marquis move and sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The adoration tempered with awe which Roland felt for
him had received, if it needed it, a fresh impetus through
last night’s happenings. An eager and interested witness
of the scene’s beginning, an unwilling and indignant one
of its close, Roland had felt, and still felt, that he hated
M. de Brencourt for the torture to which, even unwittingly,
he had put him, as anyone could see. And why, as Artamène
had whispered to him afterwards, had M. de Brencourt
displayed such an aversion to the Duc de Trélan?</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was M. de Kersaint going to do, he wondered,
about this business of Mirabel? The name seemed to
have a faintly familiar sound, though he could have
sworn that he had never heard it before. As he strove
to recover the connection a glorious thought shot suddenly
into his mind. If only M. de Kersaint would let
<span class='it'>him</span> go to Paris in search of this treasure! There—if his
search were successful, as of course it would be—shone
in truth a deed worthy to lay at the feet of Mlle Marthe
de la Vergne!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wrapped in the warm and rosy imaginings which this
idea brought to him Roland dropped off to sleep again—a
light slumber in which he had a distinct impression that
M. de Kersaint came and stood for some time looking
down on him, and from which he woke to find the attic
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
grown considerably lighter, and M. de Kersaint’s sleeping-place,
to which he instantly glanced, empty. Everybody
else seemed to be slumbering as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a moment or two before Roland’s eyes found
his leader, in the farthest corner of the attic, seated sideways
at a little table, writing—at least, with a pen between
his fingers. His chin was propped on his fist, and the
young daylight as it entered silhouetted his fine profile
with sufficient clearness for the observer to be sure that
his thoughts were not pleasant ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All his family massacred!” sprang into Roland’s
mind. “He is thinking of that—or of how to retrieve la
Croix-Fendue, or perhaps how to get the treasure from
Mirabel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How handsome he is!” And on Roland,
himself as unconscious of his own good looks as it is possible
for a young man to be, came the resolve to use this Heaven-sent
opportunity for the furtherance of his own desires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rising very quietly from the floor, he picked his way,
half dressed as he was, among furniture and sleepers till
he came to the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur le Marquis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint started and looked round. “Roland,
what are you doing?” he asked in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been awake before,” said Roland, as if that
were a reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to ask you something, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If,” said M. de Kersaint, studying him as he stood
there in his shirt and breeches, “if it is to repeat La
Vergne’s request of last night about Mirabel, I may as well
tell you at once, my boy, that it is of no use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youth’s visage so manifestly fell that his leader
could not help smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see that I guessed right. No, my dear boy, this
business, if ever it gets itself done at all, is work for a much
older head than yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not so young, Monsieur le Marquis,” pleaded the
aspirant, in the same discreet tone. “I shall be twenty
this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but not until the very end of it,” retorted M. de
Kersaint with promptitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child of December was first taken aback, then
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
flattered, that the date of his obscure birthday should be
known to his hero, who was now looking at him half-teasingly,
a mood in which Roland especially adored him.
Then the petitioner recovered himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But even if you think me young, sir,” he went on
with fervour, “nobody here, however much older he
is——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has any experience of house-breaking,” he was going
on to say, when the words were cut short by a grasp on
his arm. He turned, and M. de Kersaint, who had momentarily
lowered his gaze, lifted it at the same instant so that
they both beheld the Chevalier de la Vergne, sling and all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, another!” exclaimed M. de Kersaint. “Morbleu!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I felt sure that he was trying to steal a march on me,
Monsieur le Marquis,” explained Artamène. “If anyone
is to go to Mirabel——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would certainly not be you, La Vergne, with that
arm,” interposed his leader. “However, there is no
question of Mirabel for either of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——” began both the candidates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want to know my plans, gentlemen,” said
M. de Kersaint then, with a touch of impatience, real or
assumed, “they are, as far as regards yourselves, these—a
return, for the present, to your own firesides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are to go back home!” ejaculated the horror-struck
Artamène.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amusement shot again into M. de Kersaint’s eyes at
the tone, but because of its pitch he laid his finger on his
lips. “It is not designed as a punishment, believe me, my
children. But our drawing of the sword was premature;
I always feared it, and I have resolved, for the present,
to disband. It will only be for a month or two, probably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—but you will send for us again, sir?” stammered
Roland. All the brightness seemed suddenly to have
departed from life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most certainly. I could not get on without my aides-de-camp.
Now go back to your beds and leave me to
finish what I am doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was two exceedingly dispirited young men who
returned to their couches. “To be sent home like schoolboys!”
whispered Roland, who had left his with such
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
hopes. But they were too dejected to discuss the catastrophe.
Happy Lucien, who had slept through its announcement!
They sat side by side on Artamène’s blanket,
and looked at each other, while close by the young Chouan,
who was awake, moved restlessly. What, if they were
going to separate, was to become of him? Perhaps this
unspoken query gave Artamène his great idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not fit to take the journey to La Vergne alone,”
he whispered suddenly in Roland’s ear. “Will you escort
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will I not?” responded his friend, his eyes sparkling
again.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>With the full advent of morning came the good M. Charlot
and a servant, bringing coffee and rolls to the unaccustomed
guestchamber. To this welcome refreshment
he joined the more than welcome news that the troops
who had nearly intercepted the Marquis and his guide last
night had marched out at dawn, and in an hour or so it
would be quite safe to depart. Also, the wounded man
could now be moved downstairs to a bed and cared for until
his foot was healed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excellent, my dear Monsieur Chariot,” said the Marquis
de Kersaint. “And—the other matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have already sent to the place, Monsieur, and a
message has come back that the person your honours are
expecting has not yet arrived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Artamène and Roland looked at each other over their
coffee-bowls. They cherished a faint hope, now rapidly
withering, that they might catch a glimpse of this famous
person ere departing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But very shortly afterwards, as it seemed, the three
of them had put together their small belongings, had
received their last instructions, and had learnt how, when
the summons came to them again, it would probably be to a
more lasting campaign. The Marquis de Kersaint hoped
by the summer to have a regular headquarters at least—to
keep always on foot an army of Chouans was impossible—in
short, to be in a larger way of business. But even these
bright predictions did not cheer ‘les jeunes,’ as the Abbé
called them, very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All I can do, mes enfants,” said their leader to them
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
in conclusion, “is to wish you a safe return and a better
meeting. Remember my recommendations as to prudence
in your journeys.—I am not sure that I ought to let you
travel in that condition, Artamène.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the youth hastened to inform him that he
would have the advantage of Roland’s care and company
M. de Kersaint smiled and said, “Very well. But, Roland,
remember that your real destination is not La Vergne,
but Kerlidec. My honour is engaged, as you know, in
sending you back to your grandfather. Good-bye, Lucien;
you will now have leisure to proceed with your study of the
Mantuan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé had already given them his blessing; the
Comte had gone to the place appointed to await Cadoudal.
Even Le Blé-aux-Champs had been carried downstairs.
So when the Marquis had shaken hands with them there
was nothing for the three young men to do but to go.
And they went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they had not got beyond the next turn on the dusky
staircase before they heard M. de Kersaint’s voice on the
landing above them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roland,” it called down, “come back a moment, will
you? I have a message for M. de Carné.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wondering, the young Vicomte went up again, nearly
to the top, where the tall figure was standing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only wish you to point out to him,” said the Marquis,
“that I am fulfilling my promise. That is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he added, in a different tone, “May God keep you,
my boy!” and stooping, kissed him on the forehead.

<h2 id='b1c5'>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><span class='it'>TU MARCELLUS ERIS</span></h3>

<p class='noindent'>“And so, <span class='it'>exeunt</span> ‘les jeunes,’ ” said the Marquis de Kersaint,
coming back into the attic and shutting the door
after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Its only remaining occupant, the Abbé Chassin, looked
up from his breviary where he sat on the old brocade sofa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could wish,” he observed, “that they had departed
earlier—or at least that young La Vergne had done so,
before he brought about what happened last night, by his
mention of the word ‘Mirabel.’ But what, Gaston, in
the name of all the saints, possessed you to force me to give
you the memorandum like that, before everybody? Of
course I only meant to put it into your hands when we were
alone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis de Kersaint, seeming to find it perfectly
natural to be addressed thus familiarly by his inferior,
shrugged his shoulders. “Why then, my dear Pierre, did
you, in your turn, say before everybody that your information
was for my private ear? A slip of that kind is
unlike you. How could I possibly accept for my private
ear any news about the place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, perhaps not, but your persistence, if you will forgive
my saying so, rather drove me into a corner. However,
I dare say we were both equally to blame, I for not
being readier-witted, and you for—well, for taking the bull
a little too much by the horns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint, evidently not at all resenting these
criticisms, looked down at the priest. “Above all things
I did not want to create a mystery,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And instead of that you created a kinsman,” observed
the Abbé with a half smile, and then became grave again.
“It was very unfortunate, the whole thing, but naturally
we had neither of us any idea of what it was going to
lead to.”
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis de Kersaint’s face darkened. He turned
away, and began to walk up and down. “You made a
fine holocaust of my imaginary family,” he said after a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to stop him somehow,” replied the Abbé briefly.
He had closed his book, and was watching the pacing
figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that,” said M. de Kersaint after another silence,
“that is how a Frenchman, an émigré himself, judges the
conduct of the Duc de Trélan! I thought it was only in
England that they did not understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest had risen. “Gaston,” he said firmly, “as I
said to the Comte last night, and as I would repeat it at
my last hour, in the matter of Mme de Trélan’s death
I hold that no one was to blame—save her murderers.
She could not have been saved. Did his Highness the
Duc de Penthièvre save his daughter? We know that he
tried. Not an archangel could have saved Mme de Lamballe.
So with Mme de Trélan that day. You know
that as well as I, and M. de Brencourt, if he were not
ridden by some demon of spite, knows it too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She went through that door, as he said,” continued
M. de Kersaint. He had come to a standstill; his face was
ashen. “She saw .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. before——And
she might have taken the road to England and safety two
years earlier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true,” answered the priest. “She had the
chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said his foster-brother, looking at him as if
he did not see him, “she had the chance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and refused
it. I cannot tell de Brencourt that. But, O my God,
what a tragedy of mistakes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was backed now against a huge old wardrobe, motionless,
almost as if he were nailed to it, voice and eyes alike
full of that seven years’ old horror and anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was but a mistake, a misunderstanding, then,
Gaston,” said the priest quickly. “You acknowledge
that, you see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man against the wardrobe gave a laugh. “But
what is worse than a mistake, Pierre? Not a crime,
certainly. Mistakes appear, at least, to be more heavily
visited in this world. It seems to me that I am about
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
to begin a fresh series of payments for mine.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As for
her, if she made any, she paid—how much more than
paid!—in that moment of martyrdom that does not bear
thinking of, that I still dream about, it seems to me, almost
every night.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now, if it is to be dragged out as de
Brencourt dragged it yesterday, I shall wish you had not
turned me from my purpose seven years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dear saints, thought the priest, looking at him compassionately,
are we, after all he has suffered, to go once more
through the inferno of those dreadful days in England?
For a moment he saw again that lofty, richly-furnished
room in London where the proudest man whom Pierre
Chassin had ever met or read of sat with his whole
existence fallen in a day to ruins about him—his honour
tarnished and his self-respect in the dust. For he
had that day received the appalling news of his wife’s
butchery in prison—not having known, even, that she was
a prisoner—and he had heard also that he was in consequence
being talked about in no flattering terms throughout
those same London drawing-rooms where he had
been so courted. Indeed—not then knowing why—he
had that very morning been cut in St. James’s Street
by two of his most intimate English acquaintances.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The candlelight on his escritoire, running over the darkly
shining mahogany before him, had showed the weapon
ready to his hand when the shabby little émigré priest,
who had come hotfoot at the news, succeeded in forcing
his way past the terrified servants into that forbidden
room .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only to be ordered, in a voice that made him
quail, to depart instantly. He had sometimes wondered
himself what had given him the courage to disobey, and
to stand, as he had done, for a whole night between the
Duc de Trélan and suicide. Even to-day he could scarcely
bear to think of the naked agony and conflict of that vigil,
and it was very rarely referred to by either of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went up to him and put his hand on his shoulder.
“O my brother, if you would only cease to torment yourself!
You have not, you never have had, a shadow of
real responsibility for your wife’s death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easy to believe, is it not?” remarked the other with
a ghastly smile, “when men speak still as de Brencourt
spoke last night!”
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé made an almost impatient movement. “It
is quite impossible that the Comte really thinks what he
says! Why, thousands of men emigrated without their
wives,—just as some wives without their husbands—and
no one thought it anything but natural and right in those
days .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a duty even! All the noblesse were equally
blinded as to what was coming. And can you seriously
maintain that any blame attaches to you for what happened
two years later, because you were no clearer-sighted than
the rest—the rest who, like you, were in exile?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the rest,” said the Marquis de Kersaint, staring
down before him at his locked hands, “were not, in 1792,
merely amusing themselves in exile, whatever they may
have been doing in 1790.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Even though I had not
been by her side, if I had been where I ought to have been
long before, in the army of the Princes or with Condé, do
you think that de Brencourt would say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. those things?
Or that they would be like death to me, if he did? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You see you cannot answer that, Pierre!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mon frère,” said M. Chassin quietly, “that delay
has been expiated. The question for the moment is,
whether M. le Comte suspects your identity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint moved a little. “Do you think he
possibly can? I never remember seeing him before in my
life, until he was assigned to me last December in Jersey
as my lieutenant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if he had ever chanced to see you before the
Revolution,” went on the priest musingly, “this bitter
resentment he seems to have would have shown itself
ere now. No, he could have had no grounds for suspicion
of any kind before last night and the business of
Mirabel. It was evidently only the mention of that
name that roused him. If he begins to have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ideas
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my advice to you, Gaston, is to tell him who you are.
He knows, as most people do, about the part you played
at Rivoli, not to speak of what you are doing now, so he
would not continue——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” broke in the Marquis, making a violent
gesture of negation. “I desire never to hear that old
name of mine again in this life! And I forbid you once
more to tell anyone in the world—<span class='it'>anyone</span>—whatever you
might think would be gained by it! Is it a promise?”
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have had my promise once for all, Gaston.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will never see you again if you break it!” said his
foster-brother with vehemence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I kept it so ill these seven years, then, that you
think a threat is necessary?” asked the priest gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear Pierre, forgive me!” cried the other
instantly, and he held out his hand. “When a man
starts threatening the best friend he ever had, to whom
he owes not only his life but his sanity, it looks rather as if
that sanity was leaving him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not see much signs of that,” said the priest, with a
smile, as he took the proffered hand. “And last night’s
business was horrible. I have always thought,” he went on
reflectively, “that M. le Comte was an embittered man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I had known,” said his foster-brother in a low voice,
“that he had ever met her, I would never have consented
to work with him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I never should have known
save for this strange business of Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is a business which must be attended to,
I suppose,” the priest reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose so, too,” said M. de Kersaint rather
wearily. He went to the nearest table, and sitting down
pulled out the parchment and flattened it out on it. The
Abbé came and studied it over his shoulder for a while in
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you think of it, Gaston?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have very little doubt that it is genuine. As a child,
I once heard my grandfather speak of the legend, but he
dismissed it as being only a legend. In those days I
thought the idea romantic and fascinating. Did I never
mention it to you when I came to Rosmadel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never,” said the priest, suddenly seeing himself as he
was in those days, a little barefooted boy going birdsnesting
with a young prince in velvet whom he had the right to call
brother. “Had you done so I should not have forgotten
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not believe that I ever gave it a thought after I
came to man’s estate,” went on the Marquis musingly.
“It must have gone back to the region of fairy stories.
And this old lady—what was her name?—you did not
mention it, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Purposely so,” replied the Abbé, dropping into a chair
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
beside him. “Her name was Magny, Mlle Magny. She
was for years, she said, tiring-woman to Mme la Duchesse
Douairière.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hearer clasped his hands over his eyes. “I remember
the name,” he said after a moment. “I recall her too,
I think. She must be well advanced in years now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was yesterday,” agreed the priest. “To-day—who
knows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis looked up. “She is dead then? I did not
gather that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She died while I was with her.” They both fell silent,
M. de Kersaint fingering the parchment—gone back also,
thought the priest, to a distant wedding-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston, give me your hand!” he said suddenly, stretching
out his own. “No, not that one, the other.” And
when the Marquis in surprise had complied, the Abbé,
holding the so dissimilar fingers in his own, tapped with a
forefinger on the signet ring that one of them bore, and
said, “Are you wise to wear <span class='it'>that</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint looked down at the crest cut in the emerald.
“I have always worn it—without reflecting, I suppose—when
I gave up everything else. One is inconsistent,
no doubt. I never use it, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But anybody—anybody interested—can make out
what the device is, though oddly enough it never struck
me till last night when your hand was on the table and the
candlelight fell on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means nothing to <span class='it'>him</span> probably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not so sure of that,” said the priest, releasing the
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis slipped off the ring. “Very well. I will
give up wearing it then.—Though, indeed, I might use it
to support my claim of being akin .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not that I am
likely to wish to do that again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your kinship is by marriage, remember. You would
never use the same arms. And, Gaston, having once
declared yourself a kinsman of the Duc de Trélan’s you will
have to keep it up, in order to get at the money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis, putting the ring in his pocket, frowned at
this obvious truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I shall. Let us think about this business
then, before de Brencourt comes back, as he may do any
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
moment. Now, am I to take on myself to give permission
for the further rifling of my ‘kinsman’s’ property, or shall
I go through the farce of writing him a letter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you do that, a certain time must be allowed to
elapse before you could .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. receive a reply.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely,” said the Marquis de Kersaint. In spite
of everything a gleam of rather grim amusement flitted
over his face. “And I need not point out to you that the
money would be like manna from heaven at this moment.
So large a sum, absolutely at one’s own disposal—why, one
might organise and arm Finistère almost as well as Cadoudal
is arming the Morbihan. There is no time to lose, for, as
it is, when we get possession of the treasure—if we ever do—it
will be useless in its present state—coin of the time
of Louis XIII. and Henri IV. It would have to go to
England. Bertin would see to that, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé nodded. “But Bertin is not the man to get
it out of Mirabel. What staff, if any, do you suppose the
Directory maintains in the place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mirabel’s owner shook his head. “I have no idea. I
only know that it is a museum, which implies a guardian of
some sort. I had rather for our purposes that it was
empty and falling into ruins. Make a note, Pierre, to
write to Bertin or someone to find out the dispositions
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé nodded again. “I imagine, then, that you
will not write the letter to M. de Trélan—you will take the
responsibility on your own shoulders, as you hinted at
doing last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said M. de Kersaint, leaning back in his chair.
“And I shall probably go to Mirabel myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest jumped. “Gaston, that would be madness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? You know that as well as I. It is a great risk
for anyone to run, and for a general himself to incur a
hazard which he should assign to a subordinate is not
only folly, but culpable folly. What would happen to all
the plans for Finistère if you got laid by the heels? And
think of the self-betrayal! Could you wonder if those
quick-witted young men of yours, if M. de Brencourt, if
all who got to know of it asked themselves why you did
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
such an extraordinary thing as to go on this quest in
person?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint looked at him musingly. “You have
a terrible habit of being in the right, mon frère. I believe
you want to go yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I think I should not do amiss, though I do not
know Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if you know what a good opinion of yourself
you have!” said the Marquis, smiling. “No—though I
dislike sending him there—I think that de Brencourt is the
man to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he ever been there, do you think?” asked the
priest, hesitating a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis looked away. “No, I should doubt it,”
he said after a moment. “I shall have to ask him, I
suppose. But here is my ancestor’s plan, and naturally
I can give him all necessary details.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be careful how you do that—remember that
you are only a distant kinsman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not likely to forget it,” retorted the Marquis.
“I would far rather not, but I think I must send the
Comte. He is the man I should naturally have sent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roland de Céligny was dying to go, was he not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harebrained boy, yes! But I told him and La Vergne
that I would have none of it. It is no work for children.
He will be safely out of the way with his grandfather till
I send for him again—though to be sure I should have
preferred to keep him with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope his grandfather will be grateful to you for your
self-denial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Highly improbable, I should think,” observed the
Marquis sardonically. “I can do no good thing in that
quarter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can understand that it is not work for Roland,”
pursued the priest meditatively, “but, as far as risk goes,
he ran enough of that with us at la Croix-Fendue the day
before yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of a soldier’s death, perhaps, but not of any other.
Not <span class='it'>that</span> again, please God!” A look of bitter regret
passed over his face. “O Pierre,” he said in a low voice,
“if only that boy had been born .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at Mirabel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes!” assented the priest sadly. Things might
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
indeed have been otherwise if Mirabel had not in its last
days been a childless house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I see his grandfather again——” the Marquis
was beginning—and was cut short by the sound of steps
on the stairs. In an instant he was the man who had
entered the attic yesterday evening, not the man who for
the last three-quarters of an hour had been talking without
reserve to his only intimate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De Brencourt—and Georges,” he said, and rising, stood
waiting to receive the most notable of all the Royalist
leaders, and that a peasant. In another moment the latter
stood on the threshold, a massive Breton of about thirty,
bull-necked, wide-shouldered, with short and very closely
curling reddish hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis went forward and held out his hand.
“Monsieur Cadoudal, I am honoured to meet the bravest of
the brave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chouan’s great grip engulfed the strong, slender
fingers. “And I in my turn,” he said, with a natural
dignity, “salute the hero of Rivoli. You bear a Breton
name, Monsieur le Marquis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have—or had—property in Brittany,” replied M. de
Kersaint, hesitating for a moment, “but I am not a Breton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Georges Cadoudal <span class='it'>was</span> Breton—to the backbone—and
in the discussion which followed Pierre Chassin had
leisure to realise the force and unswervingness of his
countryman’s personality, his warlike and (on a small
scale) his administrative genius, and his justness of political
outlook. For he knew perfectly well that as long ago as
last summer, when Cadoudal had come back from his
refuge in England to reorganise the Morbihan, he had
urged the Bourbons to immediate action, pointing out
that Hoche was no more, Bonaparte shut up (as he still
was) with his best troops in Egypt, and the Republican
armies being drawn off to the frontiers to face other foes.
It was the hour to seize. But the advisers of the King and
of his brother the Comte d’Artois, who was more particularly
concerned with the affairs of the west, were, as usual,
swayed by the evil genius which always seemed to haunt
their counsels, and did nothing. Against that ineptitude
Cadoudal, like all the Royalist leaders, past and present,
had continually to struggle—as if there were not enough
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
difficulties and more than enough dangers, without instructions
from overseas that were always either futile or too
late. If only, thought the Abbé, they do not trip Gaston’s
feet in the future .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He watched him now, listening to
Cadoudal’s explanation of his system of “legions” in the
Morbihan and in Loire-Inférieure, and how he had brought
it about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Finistère, Monsieur le Marquis,” finished the
Breton, looking at the keen patrician face opposite him,
“will be a much more difficult matter, because it is almost
fresh ground. And you will find there many fewer arms
stored away than is the case in my command, where we
have been fighting on and off for six years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it,” returned Finistère’s destined leader gravely.
“I know I have a very hard task before me. But I have
just received good news, Monsieur Cadoudal. I may be able
to supply a good proportion of the necessary arms myself.
There is something equivalent to 12,000 louis awaiting me
in a kinsman’s château if I can secure it. As to organisation,
here is my scheme, if you will be good enough to
glance at it. Though I can never look to have a force like
yours, I should hope in the event of hostilities to be able
to support your rear—though indeed that would by no
means counterbalance the immense benefit to me of
having you as a bulwark in front of me. Against the tide
of attack we of Finistère should at best be only a few
pebbles—behind a rock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate, Monsieur le Marquis,” said ‘Georges,’
gazing at him hard out of his deepset eyes, “I can tell,
without even looking at your scheme, that I should not
have <span class='it'>sand</span> behind me!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later Cadoudal, escorted by M. de Brencourt,
having departed as secretly as he had come, M. de Kersaint
stood collecting the papers strewn on the table. “I
should have been happy to serve under that man, instead
of being his colleague,” he said musingly. Then he went
and looked out through the attic window at the remains
of the mediaeval fortifications of Hennebont, with their
memories of the indomitable spirit which had once defended
them, housing in the breast of the Comtesse Jeanne de
Montfort.
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pierre,” he said suddenly, “before we leave I have a
fancy that I should like to see the giver of this strange and
belated wedding gift of mine. Would it be possible,
think you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not suppose the niece would object, if you give
me leave to concoct some reason for the request,” replied
the Abbé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis gave a sort of smile. “You can say what
you like. I am afraid you must be getting inured to
deception on my behalf. At any rate I cannot betray
myself to Mlle Magny now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, one cannot betray oneself to the dead. And yet,
who knows? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps the old lady’s spirit, still
hovering round the habitation it had so recently quitted,
could realise and be glad that her offering had thus quickly
found its goal. But candles burnt now at the head and
feet of that empty dwelling, and the face looked austere,
and remote from those old desires and admirations. M.
de Kersaint took the holy-water sprinkler which the priest
handed to him, and shook a few drops on the dead servitress
of his house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I remember her,” he said in a low voice. “My
mother always thought so highly of her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wish now
that I had seen her alive, for I should like to have thanked
her for this great gift of hers, with its possibilities for
France. Could she have chosen a better time to make
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stooped over the bed, and, reverently lifting one of
the old hands folded over the crucifix, put a kiss on its
icy, shrivelled surface, while the priest gazed at him, full
of sorrowful thoughts. Eight-and-twenty years ago,
when those closed eyes had looked on him in his springtime,
what might he not have become? Lucien, who
had been struck by it, had told him how M. de Kersaint
had objected to last night’s use of the <span class='it'>Tu Marcellus eris</span>,
and the sad and lovely lines rushed into the priest’s mind
anew. Yes, more poignant than the lament for youth
cut off and blighted promise, was that for youth spent
to no end and promise wasted. <span class='it'>Tu Marcellus eris!</span> At
twenty-three he might have been .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at fifty-one? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For what the man who stood there with him by the dead
had since done to redeem the light and sterile past he
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
could not claim in his own name, and she—the bride of
Mlle Magny’s memories—to whom this late justification
of her faith in him would have been life’s supremest happiness,
was no longer on earth to see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Truly, as the great Latin knew, there was a bitter sense
of tears in human things.

<h2 id='b2c1'>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>M. THIBAULT IN CONVERSATION</h3>

<p class='noindent'>In spite of the bare six miles which separated it from Paris
in spite of its position only a little off the high-road there-from
to Saint-Germain-en-Laye, a great peace reigned this
afternoon over the hamlet of Mirabel-le-Château, those
few dwellings which had grown up, for its convenience or
by its favour, round the vast oblong mass of the Renaissance
palace from which they took their name. It was the
light, warm peace of early April sunshine, of occasionally
rising April dust, and of trees all brightly and freshly
arrayed, but, whatever its ingredients, it was a tranquillity
entirely unappreciated by the one human being in sight of
Mirabel, the sentry in his box outside that deserted palace.
He was so bored with being sentry there!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Years ago, in the bad old days, as he was accustomed
to regard them, if he had been in Mirabel-le-Château at all—which
was improbable, for he was a Parisian—the village
would not have been so deathly quiet, for, vassal though
it were of the great house which it was now his untoward
lot to guard, it beat at least with the life radiating to it
from that centre and reason of its being. But if all the
remaining inhabitants of Mirabel-le-Château could boast,
in theory, of a glorious liberty, of bowing the knee no more
to M. le Duc de Trélan, nor even to the King of France—but
only to France’s five kinglets, the Directors, to
the military authorities who bled them by incessant conscription,
and, in a measure, to that member of the <span class='it'>Conseil
des Anciens</span> who had charge of the château, Georges Camain—they
certainly could not congratulate themselves on the
possession of overmuch gaiety or even of bread. In those
same bad old days the tyrannical owners of Mirabel had
given them work, or bread, or both; no one to-day gave
them either, for there was none to give. Besides, there were
not now many inhabitants left in the hamlet to receive.
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
The village boys who, as boys will, had cheered on the
Paris mob which sacked Mirabel in the summer of 1792
lay, many of them, as quiet as the bodies round which they
had unthinkingly danced—corpses themselves in the blood-stained
soil of Flanders or Switzerland or Italy or Syria.
Those who lived were far away. In Mirabel-le-Château
now only the old and the women remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly, in the bad old days, Mirabel-le-Château had
been a more cheerful and a more populous village; but
then it had not been free. Certainly, in that time of
oppression, such of its inhabitants as were so minded could
flock on Sundays at the sound of the bell to the little
church and hear the white-haired curé say Mass and
admonish them—two proceedings which some of them
found, strangely enough, to be of assistance in their daily
lives. Now that old man was slowly dying, a deportee
in the swamps of Cayenne, there was no one to say Mass,
and even the bell, the symbol of a cult, might on no account
be rung. Yet every tenth day these freed citizens were
all but hounded into the bare and desecrated church to
hear a discourse on patriotism or the social virtues. But
were they not delivered from “the imbecile liturgy of the
priesthood” and all the superstitions of Catholicism?
Was not Sunday replaced by the more enlightened if penetratingly
dull Décadi? And whereas, in the bad old days,
the master of Mirabel had all but owned them, now, on
the contrary they, or at least the French nation, claimed
to own Mirabel. It was true that singularly little benefit
had accrued to them from the change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus the village of Mirabel-le-Château was less than
half animate, and the sentry from the guard-house opposite
the Temple of Reason (formerly the church) had to bear
his dreadful affliction of ennui unsolaced. Only a wooden
barrier and some acres of gravel separated him from the
château behind him, for the great wrought iron gates, of
the finest Italian workmanship, had been destroyed when
the present proprietors entered so tempestuously on their
new acquisition seven years ago. These gates had been
very economically replaced, all the time that the deceased
Convention was in power, by a cord bearing a knot of
tricolour ribbon and the legend, “Défense d’entrer,”
written on a card in violet ink that had run and paled
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
with the rain. But now, under the Directory, a neat
wooden barrier spanned the wide space between the stone
gateposts with their mutilated shields and lions, a barrier
bearing a painted notice which, headed “Ci-devant
château de Mirabel, Bien National,” went on to state that
since the Government intended eventually to turn the
château into a museum of art treasures, citizens were
already at liberty to visit it twice in the “décade,” on
payment of a fee. Practically nothing, as yet, had really
been done towards the formation of the proposed museum,
and if the Directory, always pressed for money, depended
for this consummation on the payments of visitors it
could have amassed very little towards that object. Meanwhile
it had locked up such of the rooms as had not been
entirely stripped of pictures and furniture, installed a
female concierge with power to summon relays of <span class='it'>femmes
de journée</span> to her aid, and kept what seemed to be a rather
unnecessary sentry till nightfall at the entrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this sentry, fixed bayonet and all, lounged to-day
in his box as though he had never known the meaning of
drill, as though he were not a National Guard from what
had been one of the most turbulent sections of Paris.
He sighed as he sat there, his musket between his knees,
he fidgeted with his white cross-belts, he drummed with
his heels; a member of a free people felt himself very
much in bondage this afternoon. He would not be relieved
till another hour and a quarter had dragged by.
For a few minutes’ conversation with some human being
of whatever station, sex, or age, he would have given
almost anything that he could think of. But the village,
round the corner to his right, seemed uninhabited as well
as invisible; even the cabaret on his other hand, between
him and the high-road at right angles some half-mile away,
might as well have been shut, for all the company it was
receiving or emitting. Though he could not betake
himself thither, sheer boredom was making the Citizen
Grégoire Thibault altruistic. To see anybody go in,
even.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it was in looking dejectedly along the
poplar-bordered road to the Café du Musée that he became
aware of a cloud of dust settling down in the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little interest sprang into his veiled eye; he leant
forward out of his box and spat upon the ground with a
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
return of vigour. That dust must betoken the passing of
the diligence from Paris to Saint-Germain. Now, had it set
down any one for Mirabel-le-Château? Very improbable;
but if it had the traveller would be obliged to pass him to
get to the hamlet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was nobody, of course,
and, as to talk, only the conversation of the poplars with
the breeze. “Oh, sacré métier!” groaned the Citizen
Grégoire, and took out his pipe as a last resource. There
was no one to report him to the sergeant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pushed down the coarse tobacco by means of a handsome
gold and bloodstone seal with a coat of arms, loot
from the great pillage, which he had bought last year for
ten sous on the Quai de la Mégisserie, began to feel for his
tinderbox, and stopped. The diligence <span class='it'>had</span> set down a
passenger after all!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the sunlit road under the poplars was advancing
the figure of a woman, carrying a little covered basket in
her hand. By her gait she was young. So much the better.
Thibault rose to his feet; it seemed too good to be true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be conceded that, as the godsend came nearer,
he suffered a measure of disappointment. The woman
was not young—but neither was she old. She was walking
rather slowly, with her eyes on the ground, but when she
was quite near she lifted them and looked at him, and
M. Thibault perceived that she was about to stop of her
own accord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-day, la femme!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-day, citizen sentry,” she returned. “This is
the only entrance to the château, is it not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice was very sweet—though indeed any voice
would have fallen like music on the ears of Grégoire just
then. The eyes which she raised to him were noticeably
well-set; under her decent black bonnet he saw fair hair
turning grey. She was tall and generously made; he took
her to be about forty-five. Then her little covered basket
and her air of having business there suddenly recalled to
him a fact he had totally forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Name of a pipe!” exclaimed he, slapping his musket.
“Is it possible, citoyenne, that you are the new concierge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman nodded. “Yes, citizen sentry. I was
instructed to come this afternoon. My baggage, a small
trunk, should have arrived already.”
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it has,” said M. Grégoire Thibault
musingly, and he rubbed a rather bristly chin. “If I had
seen anything of it, I shouldn’t have forgotten that you
were coming. But perhaps it arrived this morning before
I was on duty.” He appeared to be ruminating on this
possibility, but in reality he was thinking to himself,
“She has been a fine woman, that, once!” Aloud, he said,
“I knew, of course, that Mère Prévost was giving up her
job, but I had forgotten that she was to leave to-day. Her
man has come back from the wars, I believe, short of an
arm. And so you are the new caretaker, citoyenne?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took another look at her. “Le diable m’emporte,”
he thought this time, “if she is not a fine woman still!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Resting his musket against the sentry-box he went slowly,
fishing out a key, to the movable portion of the barrier.
But having got there, instead of unfastening the padlock
he turned round again, leaning against the bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I hope you’ll like this business, citoyenne,”
he began conversationally. “Pretty dreary, I take it,
living alone in that great house there, full of nothing but
memories of the time of the Tyrant, and of the bloodshed
the day the people took it. If one believed in ghosts,
now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t believe in them, evidently, Citizen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope I am a better patriot,” responded the National
Guard with dignity. “Ghosts, the so-called saints, prayers
for the dead, the Republic has done away with all that
nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there has been a good deal done away with these
last ten years.” The tone of this remark a little puzzled
Grégoire, but he continued nevertheless, “Still, I must
confess that Décadi doesn’t often see me at the Temple,
unless there’s a wedding. It’s just a little wearisome.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But my wife in Paris goes to the Temple of Genius regularly—the
late <span class='it'>edifice Roch</span>, as you know—and says she likes
it, especially since they have instituted recitations by the
children, and our youngest took a prize. But what were
we speaking of?—ah, the château. Well, if I were not a
good patriot, and disbelieved in saints and angels and all
that rubbish, I might be tempted to think that the ci-devant
Duchesse walked there o’ nights without her head,
or maybe with it, looking in her silks and satins as she
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
did before they stuck it on a pike, for I have heard that she
was a famous beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have heard that,” said the newcomer with a
shade of impatience. “But I have also heard that it is
incorrect,” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, beauty or not, it was all the same to her, poor
wretch, when she came out of La Force that day,” observed
Grégoire, comfortably leaning back on his elbows on the
barrier. And having thus dismissed the subject he went
on, “The ci-devant Duc now,—supposed to be alive, he
is. So you won’t meet him walking there. Instead of
Monseigneur we have M. le Député Camain; he often
comes, and sometimes the Citoyenne Dufour, who used to
be at the Opera, with him. She acts at the Ambigu-Comique
now. They say he’s going to marry her. Curious world,
isn’t it, Citoyenne? Think, if the Duc and Duchesse
could see Mirabel now!” He laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new caretaker drew her shawl round her as if the
April breeze caught her. “I think I had better——” she
began, making a fresh move towards the barrier. And
then she said abruptly, “You spoke just now of the Duc.
Has anything been heard—here in Mirabel-le-Château, I
mean—about him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Grégoire shook a waggish finger at her. “No, no,
nothing more is known about him. And take care,
citoyenne concierge!” he added grinning. “It doesn’t do,
since Fructidor, to be too much interested in aristocrats
as high up as that, especially when they are still émigrés.
But I believe from what I have heard, that Monseigneur
le Duc could turn any woman’s head. I don’t suppose,
however, that you ever saw him, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am from the provinces,” was the new concierge’s
reply. “I only came to Paris after the tenth of August.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you missed something!” said the National Guard
regretfully. “I wasn’t at the storming of the Tuileries,
but I saw the place afterwards. And this nest of ci-devants,
as I daresay you’ve heard, was rushed two days
later, by patriots from Paris. Not so much fighting, of
course, as in the Place du Carrousel, since there were no
troops here, but they barricaded the place as well as they
could, and the Duchesse’s maître d’hôtel was killed outside
her boudoir, and two or three servants on the stairs and
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
so on. Then the house was pretty well looted; I’ve heard
the citizen Camain regret that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The concierge looked away from him at the great façade.
“And how was it that the Duc escaped?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did he escape! He did not need to escape!”
retorted the sentry. “He wasn’t there. He had emigrated
long before that. That’s what saved him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he could not know, long before, what was going
to happen in 1792,” said the woman, almost as if she were
defending M. de Trélan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe not,” returned the National Guard indifferently.
“All I know is that he wasn’t here. But she was—the
ci-devant Duchesse—and that was the end of her, after
a few days of La Force. Myself, I don’t approve of
murdering prisoners, especially those of the sex, though
the woman Lamballe, being such a friend of the female
Capet—as we used to call her before Thermidor—doubtless
deserved what she got. But as for this Duchesse, I have
heard that she was always kind to the poor, here and elsewhere.
But what would you have? Mistakes happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed the concierge, looking at him. “But,
no doubt, she is well out of this world. It is not too merry
a one, Citizen, even, perhaps, for a Duchesse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Thibault, who was in reality a sympathetic soul,
and by no means the blood-boltered patriot he liked to
paint himself at times, said to this, “You have known
trouble, Citoyenne?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have known what it is to lose my husband, my home,
and every penny I had. But I am not faint-hearted; do
not think that! One goes on to the end, does one not,
citizen sentry—till the relief?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sacré tonnerre, yes!” asseverated the citizen sentry,
struck. “I see you are a good-plucked one, Madame.
Well, I shall like to think of you behind me in the château
there, and if ever there’s anything you want doing for
you, I’m your man. Grégoire Thibault is my name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new concierge thanked him with a smile which
caused a sensible warmth to flow over the Citizen Grégoire,
and made him regret still more that he could not decently
keep her waiting any longer. He fitted the key slowly
into the lock, saying, “You’ve got your warrant with
you, I suppose, Madame?”
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman held it out at once—an official document
duly stamped and sealed, appointing the widow Vidal,
sempstress, of the Rue de Seine, concierge of the ci-devant
château of Mirabel, in room of the woman Prévost, resigning
that charge. The document was signed by the Deputy
Camain, the administrator of Mirabel, and countersigned
by one of the five Directors, Larevellière-Lépeaux.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Vidal,’ ” murmured the sentry, studying it. “Parfaitement.”
He returned the paper and at last unfastened
the barrier. “Do you see those two bits of
balustrading, Madame Vidal, on either hand of the great
steps? When you get there you will find that there is a
stairway the other side of them, going down to the basement
storey. The left-hand one has ‘Concierge’ on it.
You go down there. Mme Prévost will probably be on
the look-out for you. Good-luck to you, Citoyenne!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent her head again with that smile which had
charmed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Citizen. I think I shall find my way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Ah, there is one thing I forgot. I have lived in Paris for
some years with my niece Mme Tessier, and it is probable
that she may come to see me soon—that she will come
regularly, in fact. She will have a pass from M. Camain
himself. I suppose therefore that there will be no difficulty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that will be all right. No need to bother about
that,” replied M. Thibault heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mme Vidal passed through the barrier. As she
did so she not unnaturally glanced up at the broken stone
lion on one of the gateposts which still held between its
paws the defaced shield of the Ducs de Trélan. The man,
who saw the movement, made a gesture of half-tolerant
contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those watchdogs won’t bark at you now—nor at
any one!” he remarked. But Mme Vidal seemed not to
have heard him; nor did he, on his side, observe that she
had caught her underlip between her teeth like one in
sudden pain. Then she began to walk steadily towards
the great house.
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c2'>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>LE PALAIS DE FAIENCE</h3>

<p class='noindent'>A trifle of agitation might easily have been excused in
any prospective caretaker confronted for the first time by
the château of Mirabel. Since there was, on this side of
it, no half-concealing avenue, nor, indeed, trees of any
kind whatever, but only the prone skeletons of what had
been a series of formal gardens, the whole towering extent
of the façade broke in one oppressive moment upon eye
and brain. And that, no doubt, was why Mme Vidal,
walking at first with fair speed towards it over the wide
gravel approach, suddenly came to a standstill, and, gripping
tightly the handle of her basket, stood like a statue,
gazing, across its forlorn parterres, at the overpowering
bulk of her new home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forty-two years had gone to the making of Mirabel.
Begun in 1528 for François I., at the same time as that other
palace of Fontainebleau, it had risen under the eyes of
successive Royal architects, de l’Orme and Primaticcio,
till it became the great château reckoned, in that day of
the French Renaissance, so wonderful a novelty—a residence
not built round courtyards one or many, but constructed
in a solid mass, a parallelogram of great length
and height, whereof the north side exactly reproduced
the south and the east the west. And Girolamo della
Robbia, brought from Italy, had ornamented it in every
part with details of many-coloured majolica.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it stood, this great pile, before the eyes of Mme
Vidal—its five-storeyed façade cut, as it were, into three
portions by the two square-faced towers which ran up it,
and which were repeated, something larger and more
aspiring, at the corners. Along both of the two lower
storeys, making a sort of colonnade or loggia in front of
the tall windows, went richly decorated arcading, fifteen
bays of it, lofty and round-arched. Interrupted by similar
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
towers at intervals the colonnading ran, in fact, round the
entire building. But the five bays of the central portion
were more deeply recessed than the others, for at their
pillar bases stretched, from tower to tower, twelve immensely
long, wide and shallow steps. Save for the
absence of these steps and of the great entrance door to
which they led—and for a difference, also, in the frieze
over the arches—the second storey exactly reproduced
the first. But the third and fourth gained a measure of
variety from the absence of the colonnading; though
on the third there was still an uncovered terrace or balcony.
Here too the windows, no longer so lofty, showed differing
schemes of ornamentation, the frames of the lower row
being supported by a sort of winged design, the upper
accompanied by flat columns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, despite these devices to break monotony, it was
with relief that the eye, travelling upwards over this
regular assemblage of colonnades and windows, came at
last to the high-pitched roofs, with their agreeably different
levels, their dormer windows, and their tall, ornate chimney-stacks.
The roof of the midmost portion of the château,
between the two central towers, was the lowest; yet even
this, after putting forth two great decorated chimneys,
suddenly soared up at each end into a peak higher even
than those of the towers. And on either hand of it sprang
the great pointed pavilion-roofs of the side wings, much
higher again, and blossoming, they also, into the most
intricately ornamented chimneys and dormer windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And everywhere there was this astounding many-hued,
glazed and highly-modelled decoration, lavished in frieze
and medallion from the richly diapered soffits of the
arcading on the ground floor to the very crests of the roofs
themselves. It was true that it did not glitter so brightly
in the sun of 1799 as in that of 1570, that more than two
centuries of exposure to northern weather had dimmed—not
perhaps to its disadvantage—something of the Italian’s
lustre and colouring, and that the far more destructive
human agencies of the last seven years had obliterated
some of his ornaments altogether, yet Mirabel still was a
“palais de faïence,” still supported the enthusiastic
testimony of a Renaissance contemporary that its mass was
“fort éclattante à la veue.” And even if the decoration
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
were too exuberant, even if the whole building were imposing
rather from sheer size than from any other architectural
virtue, it was undeniably a great house, with a
majesty and a history of its own, a house that bore out
the proud motto of its vanished owners, <span class='it'>Memini et permaneo</span>—‘I
remember and I remain.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the château of Mirabel, built for the first King
of the Valois-Angouléme branch, whose salamander still
in places adorned it, and given by the last to his favourite,
César de Saint-Chamans, Marquis de Trélan. Up and down
those great steps, in the last two hundred years, had gone
many a prince and warrior and statesman and courtier,
many a great lady and fair. Mirabel with its colonnades
and majolica had known much revelry, much wit, much evil;
some good deeds, no little patronage of art and letters, now
and then a liberal charity; once or twice, in brides of the line,
some approach to saintliness. And it had sheltered always
a brilliant courage, a brilliant egoism, an astoundingly
tenacious self-will, and a pride as great as the Rohans’.
For these last qualities it had been no unfit setting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as it was; and a poor semptress from
Paris, whom the warrant of that little hunchbacked, cross-grained
Angevin attorney, the Director Larevellière-Lépeaux,
had appointed its only tenant, stood in front of
the blind, shuttered mass and gazed at it. The sun might
strike on the majolica, but how eyeless looked those great
lofty windows of the lower storeys, through that empty
colonnading where no one ever now walked or talked!
The glass was gone from some of them. Everything was
dead, ruined, deserted—a pulseless body. Only, over the
level central roof, against the clear sky of afternoon, voyaged
with light heart a feather of an April cloud, and the April
breeze shook cheerfully the few self-sown flowers that
flaunted haphazard in what was the mere chart of the formal
gardens. But Mme Vidal’s eyes were on the house, and
the house only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently a lively discussion of sparrows took place near
her on the gravel. The angry cheeping appeared to rouse
her, and she began to go on again towards the château,
while the victor of the affray, hopping to the basin of a
sunken fountain, drank delicately of that water with which
the spring rains, and they alone, had filled it.
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Very soon the new concierge was close enough to the
house to distinguish plainly the winged beasts, like dragon-headed
horses, that went in couples, face to face, all along
the frieze running above the colonnading of the ground
floor, and the medallions of classical heads that filled the
spandrils below the frieze, and the Doric entablature of
the next storey. Walking now like an automaton, she
came nearer and nearer, and stood at last at the foot of
the great steps, and, looking up, saw, over the blotched
and discoloured marble, through which the grass was
pushing triumphant fingers, how the great door, visible
now through the richly diapered archway, was roughly
mended and yet more roughly boarded up. It still wore
the scars of that August day seven years ago when, for the
first time in all its proud history, it had been opened to a
will that was neither its master’s nor the King’s. At it,
too, the concierge stood a moment or two gazing, then, as
she had been directed, she turned to her left hand, and
began to descend the steps which led from the ground
level at the foot of the tower towards the basement offices.
These steps, at the base of either tower, were invisible
till one was close to the house, since they were screened by
a line of stone balustrading, but, as the sentry had said, a
board with a legend and a downward-pointing hand directed
the feet of the visitor to this subterranean entrance.
Mirabel had been greatly admired once for the possession
of this very thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as Mme Vidal got to the bottom of the steps the
door at right angles to them opened, and revealed the
outgoing caretaker, a dry, thin-lipped woman dressed in
rusty black, with a fairhaired child of three or four clinging
to her skirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope, Madame,” said her successor apologetically,
“that I have not inconvenienced you? I fear I am a little
late; the diligence was not punctual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not later than I expected,” replied Mme Prévost
unemotionally. “I saw Thibault chattering to you at
the gate; I know what he is, so I don’t blame you. From
the way his tongue goes, it’s a pity he’s not a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without more ado she led the way in, the child’s hand in
hers, and Mme Vidal followed her along a short passage
into a smallish living-room, clean, bare, and distinctly
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
stuffy with an accumulated rather than a recent smell of
cooking. Facing the door, high up, were two tall windows,
which came just down to the level of the ground outside,
itself, naturally, higher than that of the floor. They gave
sufficient light, but it was not very easy to see out of them,
for they were heavily barred. In the middle of the room,
covered with a nightmare of a cloth, stood a round table.
On the left hand was the stove, with a few shelves and
appurtenances; on the right a press, two chairs and
another door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is the bedroom,” said Mme Prévost, opening this
door, and affording a hasty glimpse of a still smaller room,
where the chief object to be seen was a short, wide, wooden
bed, covered with a patchwork quilt of various shades,
and situated in a recess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll find these rooms quite comfortable,” said the
woman. “The Government provides all necessaries,
down to pots and pans, as I expect you’ve been told, so
you’ll have what you want for cooking. And I will come
again in the morning to show you round the château;
I can tell you your duties then. I have left you enough
provisions for your supper and breakfast, in case you did
not think to bring anything with you. There is a small
trunk of yours arrived, however; I put it in the bedroom.
I suppose you know that people come to see the place
occasionally, though a good portion of it is shut up?
There’s keys—a mort of keys. Look, Madame!” She
unfastened a small door in the wall, and showed them
reposing in a sort of cupboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will take me time to learn all those,” said Mme Vidal,
resting her hand on the table. She had a look, suddenly
come upon her, of great fatigue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they are all labelled,” returned Mme Prévost
complacently. “Well, I’ll come and show you in the
morning, about nine. Yes, ma petite”—for the child
was tugging at her skirts—“we are going to see Papa.
She hardly knows what the word means; born in Germinal
of the year IV, she was, and he away in Germany with
General Moreau.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hope you will find everything
you want, Madame. I can assure you it’s all clean and
as it should be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure it is,” answered Mme Vidal. “But may I
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
not pay you this evening for the provisions you have been
kind enough to leave me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, Madame, if you wish,” replied the other,
who was gathering together some small possessions.
“There’s the bread and the coffee, and a couple of eggs—not
so easy to come by in these hard days. The milk-woman
comes at half-past six in the morning.” Reflecting
a moment she named a sum, and Mme Vidal, pulling out
a shabby purse, paid it with reiterated thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I see that you have left me some wood too,” she
added. “Do I not owe you for that also?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” said Mme Prévost, waving away the proposal.
“There’s never any lack of wood here, and the Government
lets the concierge have it free. It would be hard
indeed if they were stingy with it, considering that it costs
them nothing, as it is all off the estate. This lot is particularly
good, you’ll find; it comes from the pine avenue,
I fancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme Vidal took a step backwards. “They are not
cutting down the pine avenue, surely?” she exclaimed in
a sharp, sudden voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great astonishment dawned in the meagre visage
before her. “Why, do you know Mirabel already!” she
asked. “I thought—the Citizen Deputy said you came
from the provinces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I did—so I do,” stammered the new concierge.
“But even in the provinces .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one had heard of the
pine avenue at Mirabel. My late husband had seen it in
his youth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said Mme Prévost slowly. “Well, I will leave
you to settle in, Madame, for you look tired. I’ll come in
the morning about nine then. The stairway up to the
ground floor is a little to the left out there; not that you
will need to go up before I come. The key of the door I
let you in at is in the lock; everybody, visitors and all,
comes by that door, and you are not responsible for any
other; in fact the rest are nearly all barred up. You had
better lock that door behind me now. Come along,
Mariette.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost in silence Mme Vidal went with her into the
passage, and when Mme Prévost and the child had passed
through, and she had responded with a pale smile to the
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
outgoing concierge’s “A demain, Madame!” she turned
the key and pushed the bolt. Then she went back to the
living-room, and locked that door behind her also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back in Mirabel! back in Mirabel! Was it possible?
Back in Mirabel—though, to be sure, in a region of it
that she had never even seen before. Some of the swarm
of servants had lived here in old times. Had she betrayed
herself about the avenue? How foolish, after all these
years of self-repression! She looked slowly round. Yes,
this odd couple of rooms was no doubt some lesser steward’s
in the past. But, if unfamiliar, it was at least situated
within the shell of what had been, what still was, Mirabel—Mirabel
the loved, Mirabel the hated, Mirabel the enchanted
palace, Mirabel the purgatory.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went suddenly to the cupboard in the wall, and
putting in her hand drew out the keys. Yes, she was once
more, in a sense—but in what a sense—the châtelaine of
Mirabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, flinging them back clashing into their seclusion,
she sat down at the table, buried her face in her hands and
began to laugh. There was never a laugh more mirthless,
yet the situation had its humours. At her, indeed, the
“watchdogs” on the disfigured gateposts, as the sentry
had termed them, would never even have growled. The
new concierge of Mirabel’s fallen estate had once been the
mistress of Mirabel’s magnificence, for Mme Vidal the
caretaker was Valentine de Saint-Chamans, was the
Duchesse de Trélan in person.
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c3'>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>NINE YEARS—AND BEYOND</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>The general belief that the Duchesse de Trélan, thrown
into prison when Mirabel was sacked, had shared the
terrible fate of the Princesse de Lamballe, though it was
unfounded, had a large amount of probability to justify
it. Valentine de Saint-Chamans had come very near to
being cut down by the weapons of the killers in that
shambles of a street outside La Force on the 3rd of
September, 1792—so near it indeed that her entire
disappearance from that hour was assigned to that cause
and to no other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had been saved on the very brink by a man
almost unknown to her, acting under a stimulus not
commonly as powerful in this world as it might be—gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Years and years before the Duchesse de Trélan had
discovered in Paris, precariously situated, a former steward
of Mirabel, had pensioned him from her own purse, and had
continued the pension after his death to his granddaughter,
Suzon. Suzon in due time wedded one Alcibiade Tessier,
a young watchmaker with ideas—the Duchesse, who was
fond of her for her own sake, contributing her dowry.
After that Valentine lost sight of her protégée, and for
some years before 1792 she had seen nothing of Mme
Tessier, so that no one had less idea than she in what good
stead her own past generosity was to stand her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first intimation of it was the sudden appearance,
at one o’clock in the afternoon of that third of September,
in the little courtyard of the prison of La Petite Force—where
only an hour and a half earlier Mme de Trélan
had seen and spoken to the Princesse de Lamballe, now
gone to her doom—of a man whom she seemed to have
seen before. This man approached her, looked her in the
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
face, said with meaning, “Do not be afraid! I shall be
there!” and walked rapidly away again. It was Alcibiade
Tessier, now an important member of his “section,” and,
as such, decorated with a badge of authority commanding
respect, though meaningless to the Duchesse de Trélan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, when a little before three o’clock several
men came to take her before that mock tribunal in the
adjoining prison of La Force, he was at their head. Still
Mme de Trélan had not recognised him, and thought his
remark merely ferocious irony. But a measure of enlightenment
as to his aim, at any rate, came when she found him
confidently taking the words out of her mouth, and answering
for her to those questions that she only half understood.
It was he who at the end of that rapid interrogatory caught
her arm and, raising it, said, “See, she cries ‘Vive la
nation’ ”; it was he who, on the pronouncement of
acquittal, went out in front of her through the door of
death into the swimming Rue des Balais, he who, with some
more under his orders, hurried her up the length of that
swirling red gutter into the worse carnage of the Rue St.
Antoine, and finally he who, when one of the male furies
there, with dripping sabre, tried to get her to kneel on
the hillock of corpses and shreds of corpses to swear fealty
to the nation, pushed her by, covering her face with his
hat, asseverating that she was not a friend of the Lamballe,
and that she had already sworn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was only when she sank down, half dead, in
Alcibiade’s little shop in the Rue de Seine that the Duchesse
de Trélan began fully to realise the harvest which she was
reaping. In the Tessiers’ attic, where, more or less indisposed,
she was hidden for a month, she knew it better still.
For Suzon had quite decided that her benefactress was
to instal herself there for the present, until she could
safely get away, and she and Alcibiade so wrought upon
Mme de Trélan that in mid-October she openly appeared
as Suzon’s aunt from the provinces, arriving one evening,
for the benefit of the neighbours, with a trunk—Suzon’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was then able to attempt to communicate with
her émigré husband, and wrote a very guarded letter
addressed to his last direction in London. Suzon, who
was anxious for her to join him, contrived to get
it conveyed somehow across the Channel. Cautiously
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
as (for the Tessiers’ sake) the letter was worded, it showed
that Mme de Trélan was waiting for a lead to join the Duc
in England. No answer came. The obvious explanation
of the silence was that her letter had never reached him.
That was quite to be expected. After Christmas she wrote
again; fresh difficulties of conveyance, fresh uncertainties
as to its arrival. And again no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The reason is,” Suzon would say, “that M. le Duc
is coming himself to take you away. One of these days
he will turn up in the Rue de Seine, you will see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Valentine knew—indeed, hoped—that that was out
of the question. In that early spring of 1793, after the
King’s execution, how could a proscribed noble possibly
get into Paris without incurring the most terrible risks?
She was haunted sometimes by the thought that he had
come, and had paid the penalty. That thought made her
hesitate too about fleeing on her own account to England—always
supposing such a course were possible without
compromising the Tessiers—for her husband might meanwhile
be searching for her in Paris, since she had not
dared (again for their sakes) to give her address plainly.
She would wait a little longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, in that April, the bloody thundercloud of the
Terror broke over France. Ere the first spattering red
drops had swelled to the stream which was to run so full
Valentine found herself once more in prison—this time in
a much obscurer place of detention than La Force. A
piece of her underclothing, incautiously sent to be washed
out of the house, was found to bear a compromising mark;
the washerwoman denounced this widow from the provinces
who had a coronet on her shift. The marvel was
that the Tessiers themselves were not included in this
catastrophe, but they put up such a good defence, Alcibiade’s
character for patriotism stood so high, and Suzon affirmed
so stoutly that the garment in question belonged to a
ci-devant in the country whom her aunt had once served
as maid, that in the end Valentine was imprisoned as a
suspect merely. And as a suspect she remained in her
mean captivity for more than a year, unrecognised—for
there were none of her acquaintance there—and forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Gironde fell, Marat was murdered, the Queen executed,
Vendée defeated. The year 1793 closed; the next
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
began; Hébert’s, then Danton’s head went the way of
the rest, and at last the long suspense was ended, when on
a May morning of 1794 the widow Vidal stood before Dumas
and his assessors in their plumed hats, in that hall of so
many anguishes in the Palais de Justice, to find acquittal
on an unforeseen ground. There was no evidence against
her; the zealous washerwoman was dead, and even
Fouquier-Tinville himself, demanding his quota of heads a
day, was intent on nobler quarry than this country widow.
Her trial only lasted ten minutes. One was quickly lost
or saved just then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fishwives on the other side of the barrier acclaimed
the acquittal, little guessing whom they were applauding.
Some of them insisted on accompanying the Duchesse home—to
all the home she had. Henceforward she was more
or less sacred. But never, now, while that orgy of blood
and denunciation lasted, could her real identity be suffered
to reveal itself, or the Tessiers would be lost indeed.
Moreover, Mme de Trélan was herself beginning to be
uncertain of it. And, though her position was improved
by her official acquittal, the months of prison and privation
had left their mark on her character in a kind of
inertia and indifference very foreign to her nature. In
common with many others in those days of superhuman
strain, the love of life was running low in her. Existence
was almost a burden. She was ill, indeed, for months.
Then at last, in that stiflingly hot and cloudless Thermidor,
the spell of terror was snapped, and the guillotine came
back from its ceaseless work in the east of Paris to the
centre for Maximilien Robespierre himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the reaction Valentine roused herself to write
again to her husband, more because she felt she owed it
to him than because of any great wish to do so, or of any
hope that he would receive the letter. She did seriously
contemplate leaving France, or at least leaving Paris,
but the days went on, and she took no steps.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was
better to think that Gaston was dead. She did think it
at last. If he were not, she was too proud to make an
appearance in the world of emigration as a deserted wife.
And the few family ties she, an only child and early
orphaned, had possessed were all broken now, by nature
or violence. She was happy, too, in a sense, with the
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
Tessiers, who had risked so much for her, and to whom,
since Thermidor, her presence was no longer a menace—though
she was still very careful not to betray herself.
She began to earn money by embroidery, which she had
always done exquisitely; she began, too, to enjoy the new
sensation of earning. And when in ’97 Alcibiade died
very suddenly, and his widow, keeping a journeyman to
attend to the clocks and watches, turned half the shop
into a lingerie, Mme de Trélan’s skill helped to support the
new venture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So—unbelievably when she looked back at their added
months—five years, almost, had passed since her release,
and she was still in the Rue de Seine, having reached an
indifference to outward circumstances which might, on
the surface, have earned the commendation accorded by
spiritual direction to “detachment.” Yet this state of
mind was not in the main the fruit of the astonishing change
in her fortunes, of captivity and indignities or suspense—not
even the fruit of her husband’s strange silence. It
sprang from a tree of older growth than these, though no
doubt these conditions, and especially the last, had ripened
it; it was the lees of a cup more deadening, even, than that
which the Revolution had set to her lips—the cup which
she had begun to drink years before, when her heart had
been slowly starved amid the luxury and state of Mirabel.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The marriage of Geneviève-Armande-Marie-Valentine
de Fondragon with Gaston-Henri-Hippolyte-Gabriel-Eléonor
de Saint-Chamans, Duc de Trélan, had been
arranged, as often happened, when the bride was a child
in the convent. But Mlle de Fondragon had seen her
betrothed before the ceremony rather oftener than fell to
the lot of most highborn young girls in her day, and no
match, in the end, had been more one of love than hers
with the singularly attractive young man who came
sometimes, as was permitted, to the parlour of the great
aristocratic nunnery of the Panthémont where she was
being educated. She was seventeen, beautiful and accomplished,
when she was wedded with all imaginable pomp
in the chapel of Mirabel to a bridegroom of twenty-three,
and began with him an existence out of which custom and
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
the demands of fashion, rather than anything more menacing,
were so quickly to suck not only the early enchantment,
but the more lasting affection that might have replaced
it. For the splendid and handsome young patrician whom
she had married went his own way in life—and it was not
hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was indeed expected of a man of rank in those days
that he should either keep a mistress or be assigned as
lover to some married lady of his own world, and that he
should see only as much of the society of his own wife as
a certain standard of good usage demanded. After a few
years of marriage the young Duc de Trélan was conforming
most faithfully to both these requirements. And Valentine,
formed in that corrupt and polished society which grew
up so early, was even at twenty-one too much of her
rank and epoch ever to utter reproaches, or even to feel
very keenly that her husband’s far from unusual conduct
was reprehensible in itself. Practically the whole of the
highest society was an amazing <span class='it'>chassé-croisé</span> of such
arrangements. But she did feel it in another way, and
that sharply enough; for there was a factor not always
present in like situations—she loved her husband passionately.
And so, just as an ordinary woman, she suffered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not that Gaston de Trélan was by any means a profligate.
He was difficult in his preferences, and she knew well how
violently—and for the most part unsuccessfully—he was
run after in society. “Saint-Charmant” was the current
play on his name in the salons of the Faubourg St. Germain
and of the Marais. Nor did he ever fail in attentions to
her; nay, as the years went on, she knew that she had
his respect always; intermittently, perhaps, almost his
love. Of the freedom, not to say licence, which a lady
in her high position could claim, she herself had not taken
the shadow of an advantage. And yet, though she was
herself so unsullied, and though she was also a very proud
woman, she would have passed over in her husband what
her world, so far from censuring, almost demanded. As
youth fell away from both of them she certainly felt it less,
and the Duc’s love affairs, never scandalously frequent,
became almost negligible. It was not that trait in him
which had cut the deepest; it was the gradual conviction
that the high promise of his character and gifts would
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
never be fulfilled. Her love for him, which had survived
unfaithfulness, was ambitious, and not without reason.
More than most of his line Gaston de Trélan had capacity,
but unluckily there ran in his blood far more than his
share of the indolent pride of the Saint-Chamans. If he
could not do a thing supremely well, he would not do it
at all. Indeed, he appeared to see no reason why he
should trouble to do anything, in a world where all was
at his feet, but be uniformly charming, gay, keenwitted—and
supremely wilful. Like most young nobles he had had a
military training, and had been given a colonelcy at the
age of twenty; but not one second more than the obligatory
four months of the twelve would he ever spend with his
regiment. Indeed he resigned the burden of this command
a few years after marriage. In later life the coveted position
of First Gentleman of the Bedchamber had been almost
forced upon him; fortunately that only entailed a year of
service. Valentine, a Dame du Palais herself at the time,
had no love for the long and tiring ceremonial of Court
attendance, and if only he had accepted the post of ambassador
to Sweden which was offered him about the same
period, or that of governor of Provence for which he was
proposed, she would have forgiven him had he refused
the honour at Versailles. But there existed no influence
strong enough to make him shoulder responsibility against
his will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the slow disillusionment had not killed her love.
After all, when the crash came in 1790 they were neither
of them old. And she herself, as she felt bitterly at times,
had failed to do the one thing which was really demanded
of her. She had not given her husband an heir—and
Gaston de Trélan was the last of his line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a shattering blow to a house which dated from
the eleventh century. The name would be extinguished
altogether, and the property broken up. Mirabel would
go to a cousin, the Duc de Savary-Lancosme, who would
also inherit the great estates in Berry. Saint-Chamans,
that cradle of the race in the South—which for some
reason Valentine had never liked and rarely visited—would
fall to another branch. So the Duc de Trélan
was pitied, as she knew, for what, to a man of his rank,
possessions and ancient lineage, was indeed a profound
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
misfortune. Things might indeed have been very different
if Mirabel had not been a childless house—not in the
accepted sense that the birth of a son would have
drawn husband and wife together, for this was doubtful—but
because the Duchesse de Trélan would not have felt
always, as the hope of one died, the sense of an irremediable
shortcoming, and because a certain fatal retort could never
have been made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For her husband’s entire abstention from reproach on
that score Valentine had always borne him gratitude.
And indeed no one in the world ever counted up more
greedily than she his good qualities—his generosity, his
courage, his strict regard for honour, his contempt of
anything petty or mean. It was nothing but that undying
wish of hers to see him openly what he really was which
led, after the years of partial estrangement, to their final
rupture, when, in July, 1790, the Duc announced his
intention of emigrating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He assumed as a matter of course that his wife would
accompany him from a France grown, as he said, insupportable.
Most people of their rank had already gone,
for with them it had become practically a principle;
M. de Trélan was inclined to blame himself for having
remained so long. But Valentine did not approve of
the principle, and said so; for a man of any weight and
authority to leave France at this juncture seemed to her
like deserting one’s country in her hour of need—though
the opinion was not fashionable. Her husband listened
to her, as he always did, with courtesy, but replied that
by remaining he regarded himself as tacitly countenancing
the growth of theories and practices, both in politics and
religion, which he most cordially detested. And the
Duchesse on that had frankly told him that, having for
so many years refused to take any part in politics, or
diplomacy, or military affairs or indeed anything, he had
hardly the right now to complain of present developments.
Never before had she been within even measurable distance
of such plain speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And M. de Trélan, who could never brook criticism,
was plainly more than annoyed, but he had controlled himself,
and recurred more insistently still to the question of
his wife’s accompanying him into exile. Once more the
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
Duchesse had refused, saying finally, when pressed for a
reason, that she “did not like running away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was true that she had hastily added “from responsibility”—since
she knew, none better, that the last weakness
on earth of which her husband could be accused
was physical cowardice—but it was too late. The Duc
was on his feet, quite white. “Madame,” he said, “God
made you a woman; you may thank Him for it. Do you
stay here then, with your responsibilities. They are doubtless
great; and if I do not return”—he took no notice of
her as she tried to break in—“if I do not return, you can
superintend the bestowal of my property on its legal heirs.
Savary-Lancosme and the rest will have cause, <span class='it'>as ever,</span>
to be grateful to you. I have the honour to wish you
good-day.” And he walked out of her boudoir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She never saw him again. Within an hour he had
quitted Mirabel for ever, leaving her to reflect, wounded
to the soul as she was, on those two little words “as ever”
and what, after all, they revealed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in a few days there came a letter from him begging
her, not without a certain stiffness, to forgive him for
what, in the heat of the moment, had passed his lips, and
offering her, if she had reconsidered her decision, his escort
to Coblentz, or, if she preferred it, to England. Otherwise,
for the short absence which he proposed to make, she
would find that his affairs were sufficiently in order not to
incommode her, and he prayed her to remain at Mirabel
or wherever seemed good to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except for an absence of feeling the letter was perfect,
but Mme de Trélan knew that it was the letter of a man
who wishes to set himself right in his own eyes for what
he considers a lapse from good taste. She thought emigration
foolish and unpatriotic—the day had not yet come when
it was the only chance of safety for the wellborn—and
she could not bring herself to accept an amende prompted
less by affection for her than by a desire for rehabilitation.
And if it was to be a short absence, why leave France at
all? Down at her country house in Touraine she was,
besides, interesting herself in a certain philanthropic
scheme of her own. So she answered the Duc’s letter in
much the same spirit, asked his pardon also for her hasty
words—and refused.
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duc de Trélan never came back. From Coblentz he
went to England, and though he and his wife at first kept
up a desultory correspondence on matters of business,
for five or six months before the sack of Mirabel she had
not had a line from him. Intercourse with England was
by that time becoming uncertain, but she had news of
him through less direct channels. By all accounts Gaston
de Trélan was much too popular in English society to
find time for writing to the wife who so deeply disapproved
of his having taken refuge there.

<h2 id='b2c4'>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>JADIS</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>But the strange twist of Fortune’s wheel which, nine years
after her husband’s departure, had brought the Duchesse
de Trélan as concierge to her own palace, was first set
in motion when M. Georges Camain, originally a builder at
Angers, was returned at the elections of 1795 as Deputy
for Maine-et-Loire, and, coming up to Paris to take his
seat, received, after a time, from the Director Larevellière-Lépeaux—like
him an Angevin and the quasi-pontiff of
that new and arid creed which M. Camain also professed,
Theophilanthropism—the charge of Mirabel. For M.
Camain was a cousin of Suzon Tessier’s, though they had
not met since Suzon was a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor indeed did the Deputy discover Suzon’s existence
till the year that Alcibiade Tessier died; but after that
he was pretty assiduous in his visits. Valentine sometimes
wondered if he had a vision of consoling the little widow.
She herself met him occasionally at meals—a person of
forty-five or so, large, high-coloured, good-humoured,
inclined to a florid style in dress and a slightly vulgar
gallantry. Report said that down at Angers in ’94 he had
been a Terrorist, but Suzon discreetly refrained from making
enquiries on that point. Now he seemed so moderate in
his politics that it was hard to understand how he had
escaped being <span class='it'>fructidorisé</span> with the other moderate and
Royalist deputies in the <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> of 1797.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Camain found, of course, that Suzon’s “aunt” had
already lived with her for years, and he was not sufficiently
conversant with his cousin’s relations by marriage to contest
any statements which Mme Tessier chose to make about
her kinswoman’s past history. Even her neighbours in
the Rue de Seine scarcely remembered now, so fast did
events move, that Mme Vidal had begun her residence
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
with the Tessiers at a very significant date in 1792, and
had passed more than a year in prison since. Besides,
M. Camain did not frequent any house in the street but
Suzon’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon, therefore, in March, 1799, the Deputy,
dropping in, in his genial way, to his cousin’s little shop,
said, after some casual conversation, “By the way, ma
cousine, how would you like to live in a château?” and
when Mme Tessier, who was sewing behind the counter,
replied that she had no such ambition, her kinsman
admitted that she might find Mirabel lacking in cosiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme Tessier’s work left her fingers. “<span class='it'>Mirabel!</span>” she
exclaimed, in a tone not to be described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Camain cocked his eyebrow at her. “Yes, Mir-a-bel!
The present concierge is leaving, her husband having come
home discharged from the army, and I always refuse to
have a married couple there. Do you fancy the job?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid!” said his cousin fervently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, I was forgetting your grandfather. His
ghost would certainly walk to see you installed there as
the employee of the present régime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mirabel is full of ghosts,” said Mme Tessier, half
unconsciously, her eyes suddenly fixed. Yes, had the
Deputy but known, the ghost of ghosts was not even so far
away as Mirabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if, startlingly, her cousin had read her thoughts, he
said, looking from one counter with its array of clocks
to the other with its piles of linen garments, “No, I suppose
you would not want to leave this singular union of science
and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. art which you have created. But what
about that aunt of yours? She is very badly off, isn’t she,—and
a charge to you, I suspect? How would it suit
her? She would have assistance, you know, for the
cleaning—she need never touch a brush herself—but she
would have to live in the place, and be responsible for its
condition. She has always struck me as a notable woman.
What do you think of that, Cousin Suzon? You see
that I am determined to do you a good turn, whether you
will or no!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And not all Suzon’s hastily found arguments about
Mme Vidal’s unwillingness and unsuitability could turn
him from his purpose of at least offering her the post.
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
Moreover, during the discussion the Deputy unwittingly
gave vent to a number of <span class='it'>doubles entendres</span>, such as
“Nothing like keeping Mirabel in the family!” and,
“It only wants a woman with a head on her shoulders,”
so that by the time his threat to go and interview Mme
Vidal in person had driven her perforce to undertake the
office Suzon Tessier was almost hysterical, and went up
the staircase wringing her hands. Never for one wild
second did she imagine that the offer would be accepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first, indeed, Mme de Trélan had seemed to see in it
an insult thrown at her by Fate—but by Fate’s hand only,
for Suzon was certain that the Deputy had no suspicion of
her identity. “Caretaker of my own house!” the Duchesse
had exclaimed. And then she had begun to laugh, saying
that it was so preposterous as to be amusing. Yet the next
moment, to Mme Tessier’s horror, she had exclaimed,
“Dear God! why should I say it is preposterous, <span class='it'>now</span>!
Tell me, Suzon, what I should have to do as concierge of
Mirabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Suzon, brokenly, had told her, hoping against
hope that she was only playing with the idea to feed the
little vein of ironic humour which she had sometimes
observed in her, Valentine said gravely, “Since this
strange thing has come to me, Suzon, perhaps it is meant,
for some reason, that I should do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, think what you are saying!” cried the
poor Tessier, all her fears back again. “You a concierge!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what am I now, Suzon—a sempstress, almost
your pensioner.” She said it without bitterness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But at <span class='it'>Mirabel</span>—and you its Duchess!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To that the Duchesse only said calmly, “I could resign,
I suppose, when I wished. And you would come to see
me sometimes, would you not? I should still have leisure,
perhaps, to sew for you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, Suzon, if your good
Deputy wants an immediate answer you can give it to
him. Tell him that—I accept.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as Suzon’s horrified protests against this—to her—monstrous
and sacrilegious compliance were broken into
by the none too patient benefactor himself tapping on
the door, Mme de Trélan was able to tell him in person that,
if he really thought her suitable for the post, she should be
pleased to take it.
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” said Georges Camain triumphantly to the
overwhelmed Suzon. And to her “aunt” he announced
with a bow, “Madame, one has only to look at you to
know that Mirabel is fortunate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in this manner that the Duchesse de Trélan came
to accept her own, and to pass, some three weeks later,
into a sort of possession of it.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Now, at eight o’clock the morning after her entry, she
was already going up the stairway to the ground floor, the
keys of Mirabel in her hand, for during her night under
the patchwork quilt she had discovered that there was
one thing about which she had miscalculated her strength.
She could not endure to make re-acquaintance with her
violated home in the company of Mme Prévost. True,
she would probably be obliged to retrace her steps with
the ex-concierge when the latter came to instruct her in
her new duties, but it would be less desecration of her
pride and of her memories if she revisited Mirabel for the
first time alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at the top of the stairs she hesitated. What was
she going to find? She knew only too well what desolation
might greet her. Paris had long been a vast pawnshop
for the sale of the plundered goods of noble owners exiled
or murdered. She had but to go into the once aristocratic
Faubourg St. Germain to see a whole street of empty palaces,
stripped, many of them, not only of furniture, mirrors and
balustrades, but even of the very lead from the roofs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And outside Paris it was the same. Where were the
galleries and <span class='it'>faïence</span> pavements of the château of Ecouen,
Mirabel’s contemporary? And Anet, that palace of love,
fruit of the same brain as Mirabel, where every door and
window bore the interlaced monograms of Henri II. and
Diane de Poitiers? Of that jewel of stone, set in its
woods in the valley of the Eure, nothing but its walls
remained. Its costly canals were rotting mud and rotting
water, its parks cut down, the kneeling statue of Diane
in pieces, her mausoleum a horse trough. Chantilly,
stripped of its marble columns, of its <span class='it'>jaspe fleuri</span>, of its
panels of agate, had become a manufactory. Bellevue,
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
that haunt of the Pompadour, was a barracks; Marly,
a field and four walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Versailles itself? Versailles was the museum of the
department. The avenue under whose fourfold ranks
of elms had passed Turenne and Colbert and Corneille
existed no longer. In the chapel the very marble itself
had been split and hacked to get rid of the encrusted Lilies,
and the Virgin over the altar still held a pike in her hand.
The beds in the park were covered with brambles and
weeds, the borders of the Grand Canal were a grazing
ground for goats and donkeys, the Pièce des Suisses was
muddy, the Naiads were covered with dust. Trianon was
for sale. The rooms, said Suzon, who had been there,
smelt damp, like a cellar, and the dining-room was full of
a strange lumber which Valentine recognised from her
description as the remains of those sledges on which the
young, laughing Court of 1788 had sped over the ice.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How should she find her house of Mirabel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning sun, at least, knew nothing of change
of ownership nor of desecration. It came stooping in
through the outer arcading just as it used to do. In room
after room, as she went onwards from one to the other,
it accompanied her, the only habitual thing left in that
desolation. But, though these rooms were stripped, they
were not damaged—only, in their aching bareness, very
strange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came at last to the midmost point of the ground
floor, the great banqueting hall, or Salle Verte, a vast
apartment so closely resembling in decoration the Salle
d’Hercule at Versailles as almost to suggest that it was a
copy of it. There was the same effect of green relieved
with gold on a white background, the same green marble
pillars and heavily gilded cornice. Triumphal deities
swam across the ceiling, and, just as at Versailles, two
great pictures, set in elaborately carved frames, formed part
of the integral scheme of decoration. As Valentine
entered and looked down the vista of pillars she was
confronted by the same huge canvas, saw that Æneas was
still toilfully bearing Father Anchises on his shoulders
from the burning town—the huge canvas which had
witnessed the dancing on her wedding night and much
beside. She turned almost unthinkingly to look at the
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
companion picture which used to face it at the other
end of the great room, over the hearth, and was met by a
large blank space. Dido surveying the Trojan ships, with
Carthage’s proud towers behind her, was gone. Why?
A rude scrawl of <span class='it'>Les reines à la lanterne</span> on the blank
space answered her. Dido was a queen; Æneas probably
considered to be the very model of a virtuous and filial
Republican. The Duchesse smiled; not a smile of amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing the removal of the enormous canvas had
brought into prominence, and that was the coat of arms
in relief on the stone hood of the chimney. It was blazoned
in colour, and gilt to boot; and though it had been partially
defaced, among so many quarterings there were
still decipherable enough roses and besants and castles
and ermine to show the great alliances of the house. And
at the top the phoenix of the Saint-Chamans still soared
undefeated from the flames, while below was yet clearly
to be read their arrogant motto, doubly defiant in this
pillaged and ownerless dwelling, charged, too, with a double
irony: <span class='it'>Memini et permaneo</span>—‘I remember and I remain.’
She, who had lived with it for one-and-twenty years and
knew that it proclaimed even more than that—‘I hold out,
I stay to the end,’ shivered now as she looked at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned away at last, and walked half the echoing
length of that deserted splendour with a steady step.
Small risk of losing foothold now on that once slippery
parquet!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room which next she entered had much more of the
Renaissance about it, designed as it had been as a withdrawing-room
for Mirabel’s first royal owner. The great
feature of this apartment—known always as the “sallette”—was
the vast chimneypiece, behind which ran a staircase
mounting to a kind of tribune or gallery, as in a
chapel. The tapestry representing the history of St. Louis
of France, which had clothed the walls of this room since
the reign of Louis XIII. at least, had never been removed
till the Revolution, nor the furniture of the same epoch, for
the “sallette” had always been something of a curiosity, and
here the phoenix of the house of Trélan had never replaced
the crowned salamander of the Roi Chevalier. But now the
place was despoiled alike of the furniture and of the woven
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
story of the royal saint—all but one strip a few feet long,
whose scorched edges testified to the passage of fire upon
it. It was part of King Louis’ embarkation at Aigues
Mortes for the Holy Land, and over his armour, as Valentine
remembered, he had worn a mantle sown with fleur-de-lys—indeed,
some were still visible.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme de Trélan did not spend much longer on the ground
floor. On the next, whither she now mounted, were
rooms she had preferred, the little Galerie de Diane, for
instance (large enough in any smaller house) where most
of the older tapestry used to hang. She supposed it would
not be there now. But it was: Brussels and Gobelin
and Mortlake and some old Arras. Yes, there was the
piece of Arras she had loved as a bride—a little world of
leaves with its small merry woodland creatures interminably
roaming and leaping about in it. And there was the
piece of English tapestry, Soho or Mortlake, of which the
Duchesse Eléonore had been so fond. Here, too, in a
sixteenth century piece from the looms of Paris, was the
deathless bird of the Trélans rising from a perfect sea of
flames, and surrounded very oddly by a quantity of angels
and martyrs, the device floating in a wind-borne scroll
from its beak. Oh, what crowds of memories!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine de Trélan passed on. She went through the
ante-chamber, where the crimson velvet curtains were
embroidered in twisted columns of silver, and came to the
jewel of the house, the Galerie de Psyché, for which Mirabel
was famous. It was indeed a place of stately beauty,
and she, once its possessor, found herself marvelling at it
anew, seeing for the first time with a gaze not that of ownership
the perfect harmony between its delicate ornament
and its splendid proportions, and the charm of Natoire’s
beautiful paintings of the story which gave the place its
name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Galerie de Psyché seemed to have been purposely
preserved as a show-room, for here were gathered together
some of the best specimens of furniture from other parts
of the house. The Duchesse recognised, for instance,
the magnificent Boule escritoire from her husband’s
private apartments, with its wonderful marquetry of
tortoiseshell and copper, and a little green vernis-Martin
cabinet of her own, acquired when vernis-Martin of that
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
shade was the rage, and other things. This assemblage
of objects seemed to her more insulting than spoliation,
and she stayed for a little by that cabinet of hers. Had
she been betrayed into an undertaking which, after all,
she had not strength to carry through?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, having come so far, she would at least go on to
her own apartments. She did not think of them with
any special affection; she had loved more her less magnificent
rooms in her country house near the Loire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came first to her bedroom. Much earlier in the
century chamber music must have sounded in this room,
for all its decorations were trophies of musical instruments,
lutes and pipes and tambourines knotted together by
fluttering ribbons. All these were carved; there was no
painting here, save the delicate ivory paint which covered
these and the panelled walls alike. The elaborate bed
of gilt and inlaid tulipwood was still there, projecting from
the wall, but stripped of its green silk coverlet fringed with
gold. This bed stood on three raised steps, outside which,
as usually in the bed-chambers of the great, ran a gilt
balustrade. Half of it was still there. So was a large
armchair of green satin and gilt—but nothing else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchesse de Trélan stood outside the broken fence
and looked at the bed where she had often lain. But it
seemed certain to her that it was another woman who
had rested under that canopy—a woman, on the whole,
unhappier than herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She passed into her cabinet de toilette. This room was
somewhat famous, for it had been decorated by Huret
in the second quarter of the century, when “chinoiseries”
and “singeries” were all the fashion, and on the jonquil-coloured
paint of its walls, patterned with gold arabesques,
queer little apes frolicked in a thousand antics, while
sedate Chinamen walked under umbrellas or fished unendingly
in bamboo-foliaged streams. Save for these, its
fifty years old occupants, the room was empty. Gone
was the great toilet table with all its appurtenances where
the Duchesse de Trélan had been obliged to spend so much
of her time, had sat so often watching her hair being
piled up into some elaborate erection <span class='it'>à la candeur</span> or <span class='it'>à la
victoire</span>, and listening, half against her will, to the compliments
and small talk of some male visitor. All that was
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
left was the great full-length swinging mirror, mounted by
Caffieri, with its couple of doves playfully pecking each
other at the bottom, and its coronet at the top—the mirror
which had so often reflected the Duchesse de Trélan,
majestic in the spreading, festooned hoop and close-fitting
square-cut bodice of traditional Court costume, the <span class='it'>grande
robe parée</span>, pearls lying in a rope on her white breast and
pearls across her towering headdress of powder and curls
and feathers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and which now showed Mme Vidal,
the concierge of Mirabel, in a plain black dress with a rather
old-fashioned fichu about the shoulders, and above it a
courageous, sensitive face with a beautifully modelled
brow, surmounted by masses of fair hair going grey—the
concierge of Mirabel with the keys in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine de Trélan looked at her image a moment
and then walked to the door. The room opening out of
this was her boudoir, where she had been sitting on the
day which had put an end to all this life. Two years
before that, something else had come to an end there too.
Here, for the first time, she knew a real hesitation; but
after a second or two she fitted the key into the lock and
entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, as a bride, Mme de Trélan had made the acquaintance
of this room, she had fallen in love with its decorations,
of the purest style of the Regency, and she had ever afterwards
refused to have it redecorated—had refused to
exchange Pineau’s shells and arabesques and fantastic
birds and cornucopias either for the prettinesses of Van
Spaendonck’s doves and rose-wreaths and forget-me-nots,
or for the thin Pompeian style of a later fashion. And thus
the room was very much as it had appeared to her at her
first sight of it—and at her last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For her boudoir with its furniture was quite untouched;
its complete preservation seemed almost to argue some
cynical purpose. The door giving on to the corridor, which
had been broken down by the torrent of bodies that had
poured through it, had been carefully put back in place.
Perhaps the same care had obliterated the stains on its
other side, where her maître d’hôtel had died for her in vain.
Here were all the chairs and footstools of rose-coloured
taffeta and silver, and the Boule secrétaire that her husband
had given her, and the commode made for her on her
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
marriage by Riesener. She had never thought to gaze
again on those familiar half-blown roses of its beautiful
inlay, all amaranth and laburnum and tulipwood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her breath seemed to stop; it all became so real again.
Just here, where the mirror with its framework of garlanded
palm-stems still hung on the walls between the windows,
here she had faced that river of violence and had thought,
half hoped, to die. She could see now the door crashing
inwards, the evil and stupid faces, the menacing gestures,
the bare arms, the eyes alight with the lust of plunder and
carnage .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but the cries, the oaths, that spume on the
tide of invasion, she could hear no longer—not even the
scream of her murdered servant, which once she had
fancied would ring in her ears for ever. No; though she
could see the catastrophe, it was like a painting, fixed,
and lacking the vitality of sound and motion—more frozen,
a good deal, than the tapestry in the Galerie de Diane. In
this room only one voice sounded, where it had sounded
in her hearing for the last time, and it said only one thing.
The room was full of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Very pale, Valentine turned
from looking at the doorway by which Destiny had entered
to look at that other, through which all her heart had
gone out, with Gaston. The scene to which that exit
had been the close had none of the quality of canvas or
tapestry; it was alive, burning, as vivid as of yesterday.
How had they ever come to it? But that she had asked
herself a thousand times in the years between. And regret
was so vain and so weak, and tore so terribly. She would
not often visit this room again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mme de Trélan locked the door by which she had
entered, she noticed that even her work-table was still
here—an oval thing of marquetry and ormulu, poised on
slender curving legs. Without thinking she opened it,
to see inside on the gathered brocade of the lining a few
odd skeins of embroidery silks, a tiny pair of scissors and
a golden thimble, and wondered whether, since it did not
seem to have been examined, any one had discovered the
little false bottom that it had. There was nothing in it,
she knew; yet her fingers sought it out. And she was
mistaken! There in the recess were a couple of brooches
and an old locket on a chain—things outworn, ornaments
of no value which she did not recollect having placed there.
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
The locket bore her maiden monogram in pearls and garnets,
but it was empty, and she could not even remember what
it used to hold. She slipped it into her pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later she was hurrying down the great staircase.
A glance at her watch had shown her that Mme
Prévost was almost due. She did not wish to be found
up here. Then she remembered that the ex-concierge
could not get in unless she admitted her. Truly she was
the châtelaine of Mirabel!
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c5'>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE JASPER CUP</h3>

<p class='noindent'>The morning that the Duchesse de Trélan was led through
the show portions of her own mansion by the former caretaker,
to be initiated into what she was to point out to
others, was naturally an initiation into a strange kind of
discipline as well. Valentine had anticipated this. But
that first morning’s experience was the most painful;
afterwards she was to find that to accompany visitors herself
was not nearly so trying. To that, she thought, she
would become almost accustomed in time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was certainly one drop less in the cup of desecration
that the family portraits were not displayed to the public
view. Their absence, which had puzzled Mme de Trélan
at first, had been explained by Mme Prévost. They were
all hung in a small locked gallery on the second floor,
together with what was left of the collection of china and
other objects of rarity, and the Deputy Camain kept the
key himself. “And he won’t so much as let you put your
nose inside,” had concluded the ex-concierge sourly. “Often
have I offered to dust them cups and saucers, and he won’t
have it. Afraid of their being broken, I suppose—much
more likely to break them himself with that feather brush
he keeps in there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the family pictures are there too, you say?”
asked Valentine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every one,” returned Mme Prévost, “except the last
Duchess’s, that had a pike stuck through it, and was
spoilt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for that pike’s activities, of which she was aware,
Mme de Trélan would scarcely have ventured to ratify
the assent which she had so precipitately given to Camain’s
proposal. There was no other portrait of her at Mirabel,
though she had often been painted.
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In a week Mme de Trélan had settled down to the strange,
lonely, monotonous life in a manner that amazed herself.
The days began to follow each other in a regular routine,
so many in the <span class='it'>décade</span> for cleaning, two for visitors. She
contrived to secure her provisions without ever entering
the tiny village, lest some of the older inhabitants might
recognise her, in spite of her altered appearance. Suzon
Tessier, resigned, yet always anticipatory of ill, had been
twice to see her. M. Georges Camain had not yet made his
appearance, but that he would soon do so Suzon had
warned her. Valentine only trusted that he would not
bring with him that Mlle Dufour mentioned by the sentry,
of whose intimacy with the Deputy she had then heard
for the first time, for there were memories connected with
the actress which she did not wish revived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the bell jangled, therefore, about three o’clock
one fine afternoon on a day devoted neither to cleaning
nor to visitors the Duchesse felt convinced that it announced
her employer. Sure enough, when she opened
the door there stood M. Georges Camain, deputy of Maine-et-Loire,
debonair even in the bottle-green habit with
mother-of-pearl buttons, cut by Heyl and therefore the
<span class='it'>ne plus ultra</span> of that strange mania which afflicted the
fashionables of the Directory for wearing purposely ill-fitting
coats. Muffled in approved style to his very underlip
in the voluminous folds of his neckcloth, he swept off his
hat with a rather exaggerated politeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, our new guardian of the Hesperides! Not that
I should wish, Madame, to compare you to a dragon!
Have I your permission to enter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are master here, Monsieur le Député,” replied
Mme de Trélan, standing back. She disliked his exuberant
politeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I, Madame Vidal,” retorted he, coming in, however,
with an air of possession somewhat at variance with his
words. “I am but the servant of our five kings. Well,
I hope that Suzon considers you sufficiently comfortable
here? She is always so solicitous about her relations—except
about me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchesse, still standing in the passage, assured him
that she had nothing to complain of. He asked her a
few more questions: whether her scrubbers were willing
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
and obedient, whether she found the responsibility too
much, and finally revealed what he had more particularly
come for—to look over the collection of porcelain before
putting it into her charge. And on that he preceded her
up to the second floor, talking as he went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You observe, Madame Vidal,” he said, when at last
he stopped before a door and fitted the key into the lock,
“that I preferred the china in here to get dusty rather
than to give the breaking of it to your predecessor’s
fingers. But needlework keeps the hands fine, does it
not?”—he gave as he spoke a glance at hers—“and I
feel sure that those of yours could be trusted about the
most fragile porcelain. I shall make over this key to you
without uneasiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme de Trélan followed him into the room with the tiny
thrill of distaste which any personal remark from him
always raised in her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and was instantly confronted,
over the glass cases, by the eyes of her husband, looking
down at her with a smile from his frame on the grey panelling
of the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drouais, the King’s painter, had depicted him at three-quarter
length in the twenty-third year of his age and in a
primrose satin coat. His left hand rested lightly on his
hip, just above the silver swordhilt which showed below
the silk. A signet ring of emerald gleamed on the middle
finger, and through the guard of the sword was stuck a
yellow rose. And in the pastel the very assurance of the
highborn, smiling face beneath the rime of its powdered hair
was as seductive as the beauty of its lines. If this young
prince with the rose in his swordhilt possessed so obviously
everything that life had to offer, who could grudge him
those gifts? He would always use them with ease and
exquisite taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blood rushed to Mme de Trélan’s heart. She had
forgotten that the pictures were here. For a moment she
did not hear what the Deputy was saying .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gaston de
Trélan was not without company on the walls. His father
was there, and the Cardinal of Louis XV.’s days, a mixture
of sensuality and inscrutability in his lace and scarlet, and
Antoine de Trélan, the marshal of France under the Roi
Soleil, greatly bewigged and cuirassed, and François de
Trélan, the mousquetaire, his hand on his sword, and the
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
first owner of Mirabel, César de Trélan, by Clouet, in his
tilted cap and earrings and little pointed beard. That
imprisonment was shared by the ladies of the house also,
and Diane de Trélan in her great ruff hung side by side
with the kind and saintly-visaged Duchesse Eléonore.
Only Valentine’s own picture seemed missing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hoped that Camain would make no reference to
the personages by whom they were surrounded, of whose
eyes she felt herself so conscious. And he did not, for his
thoughts were set on the porcelain he had come to see, and
he went the round with her, taking up with his careful
plebeian fingers a fragile little two-handled cup out of
which a queen might have drunk, touching a green Sèvres
dish affectionately, calling her attention to a biscuit group,
tendering her morsels of elementary ceramic information.
And she began to see that this self-made, self-educated son
of a small Angers builder had really learnt something
about the least durable of all the arts, and seemed to appreciate
the ephemeral loveliness of its productions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus she went round half the room with him, listening
to his commendations, and felt her husband’s eyes
watching her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This has a crack, I’m afraid,” said the Deputy ruefully,
taking up a teapot of yellow Sèvres covered with gold spots.
“Hardly wonderful, when one thinks of the risks they
have run. Some was smashed that night, I know. The
People when inflamed with zeal is not remarkable for
discrimination. Now, isn’t that Meissen candlestick
delicious, Mme Vidal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on. As was perhaps natural, the ancient and
prized but much less sophisticated Henri Deux ware did
not appeal to him. Some of the old Rouen he approved,
for it was gay, and some of the Chinese porcelain, but
not all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t think what the ci-devants could see in some
of this foreign stuff!” he declared, stopping before a large
bowl of dark blue Chinese pottery, over which crawled
sinuous dragons of lighter blue and cream faintly tinged
with pink. “I call that coarse!” Valentine, who knew
that her father-in-law had prized the bowl because it was
early Ming, did not venture to dispute this dictum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like a thing with some work in it,” went on M.
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
Georges Camain. “Now I feel I could have done those
beasts myself; look at the rough, raised outline they
have. It may be old—I believe it is. Give me something
more modern and delicate, like the setting of that jasper
cup over there—Gouthière, I fancy. You have a good
look at it afterwards, Mme Vidal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The jasper cup was still here then! Yes, she would have
a good look at it—afterwards, not now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the cup, under its glass shade, M. Camain’s eyes
strayed up to the portraits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be strange, would it not, if all these painted
gentry round us could really see us in this sanctum of
theirs,” he said suddenly, giving voice to Valentine’s own
thoughts. “That old lady yonder—she looks a terror!—rather
reminds me of my aunt Fourrier, who used to keep
the bric-à-brac shop in the Rue St. Julien at Angers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he indicated the portrait of the Duchesse Charlotte-Elisabeth,
a voluminous dame who had flourished in the
Regency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The last Duchesse of all isn’t here,” went on M. Camain,
raising his spy-glass again as if, after all, he were not sure.
“They destroyed her portrait the night the château was
taken—again that undiscriminating zeal of the Sovereign
People, more undiscriminating than usual in this case,
for I understand that the Duchesse was known for her
charities. And I have often regretted the destruction on
other grounds, because since Mirabel has been under my
charge I wanted to see what she was like, and why the Duc
deserted her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deserted her!” exclaimed Valentine, in a voice that
made the Deputy drop his glass and turn and look at her.
Then she added faintly, “I never heard.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Did he
desert her, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps that’s putting it rather strongly,” said Camain
smiling. “We all know that the aristocrats who hopped
so gaily across the frontiers in ’90 and ’91 thought they
were coming back again in a few weeks. I daresay the
Duc de Trélan had the same delusion. But I have heard
it said that he never even gave his wife the chance of
going with him—hooked it without her knowing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
believe they hardly ever saw one another. So she stayed
behind—more fool she!—and lost her life in consequence.”
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Fire swept over Valentine’s pale visage. “Ah no, no,
but he did——” she broke out, and then, finding a difficulty
in speaking, pulled herself together. “I mean, surely he
must have given the Duchesse the chance of accompanying
him!” She looked down at the floor as she spoke; she
was aware how deeply she was discomposed, and how hot
an indignation possessed her at this false accusation which
she had not the right to deny. And she went on, feverishly,
“In any case did not a great many .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ci-devants .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
emigrate without their wives?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—sometimes with other people’s!” retorted the
Deputy with a wink. “However, I never heard that the
Duc de Trélan did that. Mademoiselle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lady to whom he was assigned as admirer at the time—untruly
as I believe—would certainly never have gone
with him; she was too good a patriot for that! That’s
Monseigneur himself yonder, over the green console.
What do you think of him? He must have been much
younger when that was painted, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine was forced to turn and look with him at the
young man in primrose satin. “I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think he must
have been very handsome.” Surely that remark was both
safe and natural!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you women!” exclaimed the Deputy, showing
signs of a return to his jocular manner. “That always
takes you—never fails! They say the Duchesse herself
was not insensible to it. Well, if it is any consolation to
you, Madame Vidal, no doubt he is handsome still, for that
matter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. more than can be said for that old boy next
him. Who is it?” He put up his glass again to make
out the name of Gaston de Trélan’s neighbour, a very early
dark portrait of a Knight of Malta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I cannot believe,” went on Valentine with a thrill
in her voice, “that he never invited his wife to go with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Raoul de Saint-Chamans, Vice-Commander of the
Order,’ ” read out Camain. “What Order, I wonder?—I
beg your pardon, Madame Vidal; you were saying?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme de Trélan ran a finger nervously along the edge
of one of the cases. “I was wondering, Monsieur le Député,
from what you said, whether you knew anything of the
Duc’s present whereabouts.”
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? Dame, no, nothing at all! Why should I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine tried to perpetrate a jest. “He might appear
at Mirabel some day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t advise him to,” returned the Deputy rather
grimly. “Not, at all events, till he has made his peace
with the Government.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If he should turn up I
shall expect you to tell me,” he added lightly. “It
is part of your duties as concierge. But of course he will
never come. Why should he, after all these years?
Much too comfortable where he is, I expect—probably
married again to some rich English lady.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Look here,
Madame Vidal, I must be going. No, leave the shutters
open, please, because I should like you to go round and
have a good dust here when I am gone. I keep a feather
duster in the drawer of that console, under Monseigneur
the ex-Duc. After you, if you please!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held open the door for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know, Madame,” he said abruptly as they
went down the great staircase together, “what I should
like to do with Mirabel? It is mere extravagant nonsense
trying to turn it into a museum. There’s the château of
Versailles already for that, and at the Louvre those cart-loads
of pictures and statues that General Bonaparte sent
from Italy the year before last. No, I should like to see
Mirabel made into something like an orphanage,—run by
the State, of course, not by nuns—for the children of
dead soldiers. If our wars go on much longer, they will
need it—poor little devils!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke with genuine feeling. Valentine was astonished,
and listened with a sort of unwilling respect while
he developed the theme a little. By this time they were
outside her own modest quarters in the lower regions, and
here the Deputy, asking if he might come in, entered
practically without permission. Once inside, he pulled
from his pocket a leather case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Permit me, Madame, since I am here,” he said, “to
discharge the office of paymaster. The concierge of Mirabel
is usually paid on the first of every month, but you have
no doubt had to disburse something, and will be glad not
to wait till the beginning of Prairial.” And he counted
out assignats on to the cloth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine de Trélan flushed. Although she knew that
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
there was a salary attached to the post she occupied, it
was a different thing to receive it in concrete form from the
hand of an authority whom she did not recognise. She
instantly renewed her resolve of giving it in charity through
Suzon Tessier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I will leave you the key of the china gallery,”
said Camain, bringing out the object in question. “None
of the cases are locked, as you saw, so do not admit
any visitors there at present. Keep everything carefully
dusted, Madame Vidal, if you please, the pictures
as well. I daresay you will like to give an extra
flick now and then to the last Duc’s portrait, as
you have evidently constituted yourself his champion
against detractors such as myself—No, I like the sentiment;
I wish the concierge of Mirabel to identify herself with
Mirabel, and I am fortunate in having found one who is
capable of it. Madame Prévost, good woman, was not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I fear I must trouble you to accompany me to the door,
in order to fasten it after me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Au plaisir de vous
revoir, Madame!” He made a sweeping bow and went
up the steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Valentine de Saint-Chamans, Duchesse de Trélan,
went back to her room, found the assignats, the price of
her services, lying on the table, and, with an expression of
distaste, locked them away. Then she began to search
for a cloth to supplement the feather duster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one in the world—that just-foundered world to
which she belonged—had had unquestioned right to her
services save the Queen of France, but to serve her
(as she had done) was the crown of honour. Perhaps for
that reason Mme de Trélan found a savour in the situation—commanded
to dust her own china! There was even a
faint smile on her lips as she entered the gallery again—but
she kept her eyes averted from her husband’s portrait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sèvres now was in hands such as it had been made
for. She went over it slowly and carefully. Was it hers,
or was it Camain’s, or the property of those who had
ravished Mirabel? Not for the first time since ’92 the
thought of the problem of property came over her. How
could anything material be really owned? She, who had
had so much of the world’s goods, was now stripped of
everything, and all but constrained to accept a pittance
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
from the plunderers. Were the only things that remained
to one then, the mind, the heart, what one had learnt and
suffered? She had begun to think so. And still the
problem remained: were the rights of property inalienable,
as it was in her blood to believe them, or was this little
Dresden figure in her hand not hers by right any longer
because she had no means now to enforce that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, I am becoming a Jacobin, or a philosopher,”
she said to the little shepherdess. “In any case, my dear,
the roses round your hat are very dusty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the Sèvres and Meissen and Vienna she dusted and
wiped the Oriental ware; the great Chinese vase that
Camain had pronounced “coarse,” and that frail and marvellous
eggshell porcelain which must be held to the light
before one can see that dragons and clouds and waves
live within its walls of moonbeam. Then she came, among
the other treasures of ivory and crystal and enamel, on the
jasper cup to which the Deputy had directed her attention.
As if she did not know it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The low sun, pleased to find for once an entry at the
rarely opened shutters, danced in shafts and motes of
brightness over the dull golden mounting that had made
of it so costly a thing. Round the curve of the red-brown,
half translucent jasper ran a wreath of tiny golden laurel
leaves gemmed with pearls; delicate little vine branches
laden with grapes were woven together at the bottom to
form a framework for the cup, and the whole rested on
three faun-headed supports. Underneath, a golden serpent
with eyes of topaz wriggled its way towards the vine
clusters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That jasper cup was the last thing which her husband
had given her, not long before his emigration. But money
could not buy what Valentine de Trélan wanted then.
Gouthière, when he designed and mounted the goblet,
had not done ill in placing the little snake underneath.
Valentine had thought so at the time, and had almost
disliked the precious thing—symbol, so it sometimes
seemed to her, of her life and Gaston’s, that might have
been so different if they had not been born to such idle
greatness, a cup too richly set to drink out of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gazed at it now with compressed lips, aware that
vine and laurel leaves were becoming blurred by the slow,
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
hot tears that were rising to her eyes. Suddenly she
turned away from it, and walking at last to the young man
over the console looked up at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, he had been like that! Yes, he had had that
expression—once! “How could I have kept your heart,
Gaston?” she asked, gazing at the smiling eyes. For he
had a heart as undoubtedly as he had charm and distinction
and courage and wit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as well as riches and a great
name and Mirabel. Yet one thing was lacking always—and
after all these years it was hard to be sure what it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Or—as she had often and often thought—was it not
rather she who lacked? Yet what could she have given
him that she had not? That other men in those days of
universal gallantry had been so ready to call her cold and
heartless, was that a reason for reproach? If she could
have the past again, what would she have done differently?—till
that last fatal taunt. She did not know. Had it all
been inevitable tragedy then, fixed for them before ever
they met, from the moment they had been born?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was double tragedy too. Gaston’s indifference to
her love was his wife’s private sorrow, and not his fault, for
how could love come at bidding? But his lifelong indifference
to the claims of ambition—of duty even—how was
that to be condoned or explained? No, he was like some
tall ship, gallantly furnished and manned, that had never
made the great voyage for which it had been built, but
had drifted always with light airs, till drifting was no longer
possible .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at least on a summer sea. Where was it
now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could not take her eyes from the picture, though the
glance the canvas gave her back was like a blade in a
wound. But Gaston could not be like that now—nor like
the Gaston who had left her presence so mortally insulted.
Yet if he knew exile and material loss he had not
known the hard discipline of prison and contumely. He,
she was sure, had never been reduced to earning his bread.
What was he doing—if he lived? Married again, perhaps,
to some rich lady, as the Deputy had suggested, for if he
had taken the trouble to make enquiries about his wife’s
fate he must indubitably, like all her world, believe her
dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Taken the trouble!</span> Unjust, unjust! She knew that he
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
must have done all he could; she never doubted that.
And back leapt the memory of that plebeian’s unworthy
accusation—that he had deserted her, had not given her
the chance of accompanying him. Had he not! twice
over, once repulsed by that utterance of hers which had
wounded him so deeply as to betray him into an unforgettable
retort, and then, generously, by his letter. And the
Deputy had said.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps others had said too—for
even Suzon, if she had not told her the truth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, for the first time in all these years, it occurred
to Valentine de Trélan that her refusal to accompany her
husband into voluntary exile had done him wrong. It was
on his head, in this slander, that it had recoiled. It was
not that she still did not think his judgment mistaken.
But, of the two obstinacies set in the lists against each other
that day was not hers, after all, the more culpable? As
she could not turn him, ought she not to have stayed by
his side? Even though he were wrong it was hardly a
crime that he was committing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Deserted her? Was
it not rather she, who, remaining against his will, had
deserted him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again it struck at her, Camain’s accusation. How
dared he, an upstart, a man of the people, how dared he
throw mud at the Duc de Trélan, as far above him in
character as he was removed in rank! But whose action
was it that had given him the opportunity of throwing
mud? Ah, if they had not separated .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if she had
done what he wished.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had left the window. A blackbird in the overgrown
park outside was proclaiming rapturous things.
Inside, among the Sèvres and the portraits, the Duchesse
de Trélan, her arms outstretched on the cold malachite
of the console beneath her husband’s picture was weeping
bitterly. She had not known that it would be like this!
The life of long ago, sunk for ever beneath those whirlpools
of fury and carnage—regret for that was past.
She was strong enough to face its cold relics without faltering.
But Mirabel held, after all, not only the phantom
of a dead existence, but of a love slowly slain .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
not dead. Oh, if only Gaston were back in Mirabel again!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no living creature in the great house save
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
herself. The young man on the wall, with his indefinable
air of charming assurance and good society, looked out
into the room over the faded head of his wife, and the
blackbird in the garden continued to assert that spring
was come. Yet for his only hearer spring would never
come again.
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c6'>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE ROMAUNT OF ROLAND</h3>

<p class='noindent'>It may be doubted whether, after all, Roland de Céligny
really regretted exchanging Ares for Aphrodite. He hardly
knew himself, as he journeyed with his injured friend by
discreet routes back to Finistère and that friend’s home
near the sea. His heart was certainly sore at leaving the
clash of arms, and he still resented the summary separation
from his leader. Yet, to balance the sword half drawn
and all too quickly sheathed, were the curls of Mlle de la
Vergne, enshrined in the château whose tourelles rose, on
the third day, from a screen of chestnuts to greet the
travellers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What, in that blest abode, would Marthe be doing when
they came on her? Involuntarily Roland pictured their
meeting as a replica, and saw her again at embroidery in
the salon with its Indian hangings. But one always paints
these things wrong. The reality was even better. For
there was no duenna of a mother with her, merely a rustic
groom, when, mounted on a beautiful black thoroughbred,
she suddenly trotted round a bend of the road.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is not my little sister!” exclaimed Artamène
spurring forward; and Roland, uncovering, pulled up his
horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the dappled sunlight, under the chestnuts, brother
greeted sister, bending from the saddle. Roland thought
he had never seen anything more beautiful. He was near
enough to hear the joy and the anxiety in Mlle de la Vergne’s
voice, her stream of enquiries. Then Artamène looked
back and beckoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me present M. le Vicomte de Céligny, whom you
have already met, ma sœur, in a new rôle—that of the
trusty garde-malade. Since I cannot dispense with his
services he comes to stay with us for a few days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little hand which Marthe, pulling off her gauntlet,
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
surrendered with a smile to his salute, was it not even
more shapely, more satin-soft to the lips than when it had
dropped the embroidery needle to submit to the same
reverential greeting? And she herself, in her long blue
habit, her man’s high-crowned buckled hat, seemed even
more desirable than in high-waisted white, yellow-sprigged
muslin of that afternoon in the salon!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell Séraphin to gallop back and tell Maman,” suggested
Artamène.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so they rode slowly along, Marthe in the middle,
and talked of their adventures. The wind blew a fold of
the long habit against Roland’s foot. Except on the day
when he had joined the Marquis de Kersaint, M. de Céligny
had never been so happy in his life—for his rapture on the
occasion of the Marquis’s appearance at Kerlidec had been
clouded by his grandfather’s hostility. Now there was
nothing to stain this perfect joy, and Roland was too deeply
enthralled even to envy the solicitous glances which Marthe
threw at her brother’s be-slinged left arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sad that out of happiness may spring trouble! If the
seeds of Roland’s escapade were not exactly sown during
that short ride the ground was at any rate prepared for
their reception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme de la Vergne, warned by the herald, was on the
perron to greet them. Artamène flung himself off his
horse and ran up the steps, and, while the good lady
embraced her son, Roland had the bliss of dismounting
Mlle de la Vergne—of receiving her for one brief second in
his arms as she slipped like a feather from the saddle. Then
followed his own reception by Mme de la Vergne, small
and fair and so unlike her daughter; and he found himself
being thanked—<span class='it'>thanked!</span>—for accompanying her son hither.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Maman</span>,” sang Marthe to the harpsichord that
evening, “<span class='it'>Maman, dîtes-moi ce qu’on sent quand on
aime, Est-ce plaisir, est-ce tourment? Je suis tout le
jour dans une peine extrême, Et la nuit je ne sais comment!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was she? No! But Roland, that night, could not sleep
for exaltation.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Artamène, by his mother’s desire, remained in bed next
morning. A surgeon had been summoned to view his arm.
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come and feed the poultry, Monsieur de Céligny—or
are you too proud?” suggested Mlle de la Vergne after
breakfast. “We are very rustic here, you must know, for
we are short of farm servants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland, who would have swept a pigsty at her bidding,
followed her as to some high festival. The hens who drove
clucking round his feet might have been the doves of
Venus. And the pigeons did indeed sweep in a cloud over
Marthe, and ate out of her hand. Roland feared they
pecked too hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Artamène appeared he found them sitting in the
lime arbour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is our paladin telling you of his adventures?” he
enquired, sitting down beside them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have none to tell,” answered Roland. “It is you,
mon cher, with your wound and your sling and your
surgeon, who have the beau rôle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And all wasted on a sister!” observed the hero with
a grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. de Céligny has been telling me,” said Marthe,
“the strange story about the old lady and the treasure of
Mirabel. Do you believe it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believed it sufficiently to try to get sent after the
treasure,” replied her brother. “So, taking a mean
advantage of my slumbers, did Roland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marthe turned her brilliant dark eyes from one to the
other. Artamène shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our request was not favourably received.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, what a pity!” sighed Mlle de la Vergne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flecks of sunlight came through the linden-leaves on to
her dark hair, bringing out unsuspected warmth in its
ebony, and on to a red stone on her finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a ruby necklace there,” said Roland suddenly,
his eyes moving from her ringlets to her hand. “And
hundreds of louis in pistoles of the time of Louis XIII.
So the plan said. Oh, if we could only have gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is all that hoard to lie there, then, unused, while
the Cause goes short of money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no!” said both the young men together. “Presently,
when M. de Kersaint has got the authority of the
Duc de Trélan, wherever he may be, he will send some one
after it.”
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one—whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think very probably M. de Brencourt,” replied
Roland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he must wait—perhaps for weeks and weeks—before
he can start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said her brother, “unless the Marquis, who,
as M. de Céligny will have told you, is a kinsman of M.
de Trélan’s, decides to act without his authorisation, which,
from what he said, it is quite likely he may do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that M. de Trélan’s authorisation is not indispensable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Only a matter of form, I think. Being an
émigré and Mirabel confiscated—he can neither prevent
nor forward such an attempt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mlle de la Vergne was silent, pushing at the gravel with
a little shoe and looking down at it. “Where is Mirabel,
did you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite near Paris, I gather,” replied Artamène.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish,” said Marthe pensively, “that I were in Paris—quite
near Mirabel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear little sister, what would be the good of that?”
asked Artamène, amused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have relatives in Paris,” announced Roland, with
sudden and apparent irrelevance, “two old cousins of my
father’s—quiet, unsuspected, unsuspicious old gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little silence which followed this statement was
broken by a whirr of wings as one of Marthe’s pigeons
alighted on the gravel outside the arbour, and, looking
hard and hopefully at them out of one round, red-circled,
unemotional eye, began to walk slowly up and down,
jerking its burnished neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, if I were only a man!” exclaimed Mlle de la Vergne,
abruptly, springing to her feet with kindling eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I only had two arms!” said her brother, following
her example, but more slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I <span class='it'>am</span> a man, and both my arms are sound!” cried
Roland, almost brandishing those members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you have relatives in Paris who could help you!”
said Marthe, turning her eyes on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, no, hardly <span class='it'>help</span>,” said Roland slowly, thinking
of his ancient and peaceful kinsmen. “But they could
give me a roof.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I could give you money to bribe anyone who
needed bribing,” declared Marthe. “At least, I have my
pearls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, curse this arm!” muttered the wounded hero.
“Yet, after all, I do not see why I also——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! no!” exclaimed both the others. “No, we
know what the surgeon said. That would be the sheerest
folly”—as if what they had in their own inflammable
heads were cold wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Artamène leant dejectedly against the side of the arbour.
“I don’t see how you could do anything, Roland. You
have not the plan of the late lamented of the time of Mazarin.
You could not go and dig all over a place of that size on
chance, even if the Directory gave you permission, which
it certainly would not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I saw the plan!” retorted the Vicomte de Céligny.
“I saw it perfectly clearly over the Abbé’s shoulder that
night. Why, I could draw it now, if I had a pencil.
Nobody has one? Well, look here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off a twig from the lime-tree and began a series
of scratches on the gravel, just as a bell clanged from the
house to summon them to the midday meal—scratches
which Séraphin diligently raked out during that repast.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>By sunlight and by twilight and by lamplight, under the
arbour, on the lawn, in the salon, the rough plan made from
that fleeting glimpse of the original was constructed and
reconstructed and discussed. So much were their young
heads bent over it the next evening that Mme de la Vergne
said they looked like conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ma mère, you are perspicacious,” replied her son.
“We <span class='it'>are</span> conspirators.” But, not really believing him,
she did not pursue the question, and indeed, before she
could revert to it, Artamène looked very hard at his sister
and asked her if she were not going to sing to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland added his entreaties, and attended Mlle de la
Vergne to the harpsichord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall I sing?” asked she. “No, I do not
need any music, thank you. You must join in the
chorus, then, Monsieur, you and Artamène.” And with
a mischievous smile she broke into the old children’s ronde
of <span class='it'>La Double Violette</span>:
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span></p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“<span class='it'>J’ai un long voyage à faire,</span></p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>she looked at Roland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterwards they sang other songs.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Next day the conspirators met again in the arbour for a
final council of war. They could not improve upon the
map which the two young men had made—indeed, the
question rather was whether they had not already improved
it out of all resemblance to the original. Roland’s
immediate movements were now under discussion. Though
it must shorten his visit, they all, even Roland himself,
felt that no time was to be lost. M. de Céligny was supposed,
of course, to be on his way to Kerlidec and his
grandfather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it will be wiser,” said he, “not to go there now.
When I return.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You see, he might make difficulties
about my visiting Paris at all. So I will write to him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would not accept Mlle de la Vergne’s pearls, though
he thought it sublime of her to offer them. He had plenty
of money, he said. And he settled to start next day.
Artamène tried to salve his own fierce dejection by resolving
to accompany him part of the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, perhaps from the excitement of these deliberations,
the Chevalier de la Vergne’s arm became unexpectedly
painful during the night. It was out of the question for
him even to leave his bed next morning, and, for once in
his life, he did not seem wishful to do so. Roland’s offer
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
to delay his departure was, however, declined by him.
Mme de la Vergne, supposing their young guest to be
setting off for Kerlidec—a point on which he did not undeceive
her—hoped that he would visit them again, and
when he asked if he might pay his parting respects to
Mlle de la Vergne (having already taken a bedside farewell
of her brother), replied rather absently that she was probably
in the poultry-yard, and that if M. de Céligny would
give himself the trouble.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For her thoughts were not
at the moment with an unchaperoned daughter and what
a susceptible young man might say to her ere he rode
away, but with her son in pain upstairs, and whether
the surgeon really understood his case, and if the constant
poulticing he had ordered were right. Besides—though
this even the inquiring mind of Artamène had never come
near guessing—there existed a certain understanding
between her and M. de Carné on the subject of Roland and
Marthe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland was off before the permission could be revoked.
But Mlle de la Vergne was not in the poultry yard, though
matters connected with her pensioners had drawn her
to the spot where he found her, the miniature bridge
which spanned the little stream winding through the
grounds. From this she was watching with some anxiety
the first voyage of a brood of ducklings down that St.
Lawrence. Roland was stabbed to the heart. He was
going to danger, to prison perhaps, for her—and her mind
was set on ducklings!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Erect and noble (so he hoped—at any rate booted and
spurred) the young man walked towards the bridge.
Directly she turned, the surprise and concern on her face
healed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! you are going already, Monsieur de Céligny!
I thought it was not to be for another hour, and that you
were closeted with Artamène .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I might have
missed wishing you Godspeed because of these wretched
little adventurers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah no, Mademoiselle!” said Roland. “Do you think
I should have gone like that? I have need of all the
benedictions you can give me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what she gave him satisfied him fully—only a look,
but a look so charged with meaning—and both her hands.
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
There on the tiny bridge he raised them with reverence
and joy to his lips. Her silence, her faint flush, her movement
of surrender, whether it were ultimate or no, dubbed
him indeed her knight, going to the ogre’s castle with her
colours on his helm—invincible indeed, and supremely
blest to serve at once his lady and his King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And unregarded, in that high moment, went the indignant
comments of the little yellow navigator under their
very feet, who was finding the stream on which his inexperience
had embarked of an unlooked-for strength and
volume.
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c7'>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>CHILDE ROLAND COMES TO THE DARK TOWER</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Valentine de Trélan was kneeling before her crucifix
ere retiring to bed when she heard the first shot. The report
broke so sharply across her prayers that, like a noise heard
in sleep, its first demand on the senses was the question
whether it were real. The second shot brought her to
her feet in some concern. Who could be firing so late, and
at what? The sentry, at some marauder? But, as far
as she could judge, the sound came from the great garden
at the back, where no sentry was. Her first impulse was
to go out in that direction to investigate, but she supposed
she must not leave her post, in case she were summoned for
any reason. She dressed again, and went out to the
passage and listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, some ten minutes later, there came a knocking
on one of the more distant doors that gave on to the
garden front. She fetched her keys, and hastening along
the lengthy corridor, opened it. Outside were two National
Guards, her friend Grégoire Thibault and another. Grégoire
had a musket over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry to disturb you, citoyenne,” said he, half apologetically.
“You have not seen anything of a man prowling
round here, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” answered Mme de Trélan with perfect truth.
“Was that what you were firing at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jacques here,” said Grégoire, “was going along the
road when he saw—or thought he saw—in the distance
a man climbing over the wall that goes round the park.
He was off duty, so he had not his musket, and instead of
going after him he came to tell me, as I was nearer than the
guard house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not being quite the figure for climbing walls either,
citoyenne,” put in Grégoire’s companion with reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we separated, and each went round a different
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
side of the château. The light was getting bad, and the
first time I fired at something moving it was comrade
Jacques here. Luckily I didn’t hit him. Then a few
minutes later I saw my gentleman for a second by a big
bush of something, but, parbleu, he slipped round one of
those heathen goddesses or whatever they are. I sent a
remembrancer after him from this”—Grégoire slapped his
musket—“and I am almost sure I hit him; but do
you think I could find him anywhere in the garden?
No!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine, who knew the extent of the garden—park,
rather—so much better than he, was convinced that the
time which had elapsed between the second shot and his
appearance at the château was not a quarter long enough
for a thorough search, especially in the rapidly failing light,
so that the odds were the intruder, if wounded, was still
there. She said as much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he can stay there till daylight,” announced the
Citizen Grégoire composedly, “and reflect on his crimes.
If he isn’t there he has made off, and won’t be likely to
return in a hurry. You are not nervous, are you, Madame
Vidal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the least in the world,” the Duchesse assured him.
“Did you see what this man was like, or have you any
idea why he should come into the garden?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the way in which he slipped over that wall,”
remarked Jacques, “I should say he was young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I daresay,” put in Grégoire consolingly, “that it was
only some inquisitive lad wanting to see inside the garden.
You will be all right, Madame Vidal; he can’t possibly
get into the house. If I wasn’t sure of it, parbleu, I would
stay the night here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Grégoire Thibault, in the days of the Terror, had
been a hunter of suspects, as he gave himself out to be,
his zeal had sadly suffered eclipse since that time. It
was clear that he wished to minimise the seriousness of
the inroad in order to get home to his bed, and for the
same reason, had no intention of turning out the rest
of the guard. Valentine was not in the least anxious to
keep him from that haven, and so after a few reassuring
words the twain departed, and Mme de Trélan was free
to resume her interrupted orisons, with a conviction that
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
some man, with purpose unknown, was lurking in the
precincts of Mirabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The affair indeed was a strange interruption to the
almost cloistral quiet of the last few weeks, into which
news of the outer world came only through Suzon Tessier
or Toinon the <span class='it'>laitière</span>, or by the unencouraged gossip
of the scrubbers. For, since she never went into the
hamlet, Valentine might almost have been a recluse living
the contemplative life with brief intervals of the active.
Sometimes, already, it seemed to her that she had never
known Mirabel under conditions any different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did go to bed, and after a time went to sleep, but
woke about midnight, and remained awake, for she found
that she could not well bear the idea of a fellow-creature
lying out all night in the dark and lonely park, perhaps in
agony to boot, even though he were a thief or something of
the kind. But it was useless looking for him before
daylight. The thought that he might try to effect an entry
she dismissed. At dawn she rose, dressed, and slipped out
behind Mirabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was three o’clock, and the first thrush was singing
in that vast desert of a garden. Along the weed-infested
paths went the Duchesse, and through bosquet after
bosquet, tended groves no longer, but thickets so overgrown
that some were almost impassable. Nettles, burdocks,
thistles, briars, those raiding colonists were everywhere,
waging war against the smothering advances of the unclipped
ivy. But the little lake in the distance mirrored no
tall pines now on its tarnished surface. Of that aisle of
scent and murmurs the nearer pillars were but stumps;
the farther stood lonely and condemned against the sky.
Valentine did not look this morning at those distant
martyrs; she kept her gaze on the ground as she made
her way between the bushes or skirted the long, dripping
grass of some once-shaven little lawn. Such terms and
sylvan deities as still had heads looked at their former lady
with cold and curious, in some cases with leering eyes.
Had she been wandering there without an object she
might have had leisure to taste the infinite sadness of
that place, made only for pleasure and good company, or
to remember, perhaps, certain passages of its light past.
But she was searching for an unfortunate; and that the
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
unfortunate, when found, might prove to be a very undesirable
person indeed, that, in fact, she was disposed to
picture him as such, did not greatly trouble her. The
last few incredible years had given her a sympathy with
the hunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Full though her mind was of her quest, the first indication
that it was on the way to prove successful gave her something
of a shock. She had come to the head of the flight of
shallow marble steps that led from one little terrace to
the next, when she suddenly perceived on each a small,
reddish, star-shaped splash. She bent down; yes, it was
blood—the trail of the pursued. On the grassgrown gravel
at the foot of the steps it was more difficult to follow, but
the track began again, clearer and larger than before, on
a short flight that led once more upwards. On one step
there was even a smear, that looked like the print of a
hand, as though the wounded man had stumbled and
recovered himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus, finally, in what had been known as the Bosquet
de Mercure, she found the invader, fallen sideways at the
foot of the bronze statue of Mercury—a young man, pale
as marble and as beautiful as the god himself, and so unlike
what she had expected that she stood a moment as still
as he. That he was a gentleman was plain without the
evidence of his clothes; and he wore, as further and
indeed defiant proof, the black coat-collar which marked
the aristocrat and reactionary, the <span class='it'>collet noir</span> which had
caused so many pitched battles in the streets of Paris. One
arm lay out on the gravel, crushing a little company of
that innocent and joyous flower, the speedwell, which had
rooted there, intruding in the garden like him, and, like
him, shut-eyed. The other hand held a red ball of a
handkerchief which had probably, during consciousness,
been pressed against the dark patch on the left side of his
grey coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Valentine, her heart alight with compassion, began
to stoop over her quarry .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. stopped, raised herself
again, and put out a hand to the base of the statue for
support. In the unconscious face at her feet she suddenly
saw.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Whence came that resemblance? She was
carried back a hundred years, to a morning in her young
wifehood here at Mirabel, to an early wakening, to the
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
thrush, just heard, like this, in the summer dawn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
while by her side lay the husband who still summed up all
her dreams, on whom she had looked down with the yet
untroubled eyes of love, and whose sleeping visage had
been the very counterpart of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in a moment the illusion was fled, and she did not
know how it had ever come. Leaving the statue she
knelt down by the fallen youth and felt for his heart. It
was beating. She began to unfasten his neckcloth. But
how was she to convey him into the château? She could
not carry him. Besides, how badly was he hurt? Could
she possibly get him into that damp little pseudo-classical
temple of Ceres on the other side of the grove? But the
first thing was to try to revive him. When she had been
a fine lady she would have had a vinaigrette or something
of the sort about her; now there was nothing for it but to
scoop up in her hollowed palms a little stagnant water
from the basin at the foot of the statue, and to dash it,
greenish as it was, over the white face. Three times she
did this without any result but temporary disfigurement,
and then set to work to rub the intruder’s hands, long patrician
hands like her own, like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But that was folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grandpère!” said the young man suddenly, “Monsieur
le Marquis! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Artamène .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Where am I, then?”
He opened his eyes, tried rashly to raise himself, and
relapsed with a groan, his hand to his wounded side. “What
has happened to me? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Is this a garden?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine slipped her arm under his head. “Do not
try to move yet, Monsieur,” she said in her beautiful voice.
“You are in the park of Mirabel—with a friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared up at her, utterly perplexed. (But his eyes
were brown, quite unlike that dark grey.) “I am so
thirsty,” he said, like a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cannot drink this stagnant water,” replied Mme
de Trélan compassionately, and then, looking closer and
seeing how dry and cracked his lips were, bethought her
of a spring that flowed, or that used to flow, through a
lion’s mouth in the grotto of Latona, a few seconds away.
“Wait,” she said, gently withdrawing her arm, “I think
I can get you some fresh water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose and hastened off. Yes, the spring was still
flowing, and even the stone goblet that served it, though
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
very green, was still there. The Duchesse brought back that
water from the past; and, aided by her, the boy drank
long and eagerly, and thanked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this while the dawn was growing brighter, and
the solitary thrush now become one of a choir, and,
though Mercury was battered and green, he held out the
<span class='it'>caduceus</span> over the two figures beneath him with an air at
once sprightly and benedictory. And the one bright
buttercup at his feet, moved by the morning breeze, bent
towards them too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child,” said Valentine gently, as she set down the
goblet, “I do not know what you were doing here last
night, but I suppose you do. At any rate you were shot
at by the sentry, and I see that you are hurt in the side,
but not, I hope, seriously. The question is, how to move
you so that I can do something for your wound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The invader was perfectly sensible now. “But, Madame,
who are you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The concierge of Mirabel—of the château,” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never find it now,” murmured the young man
dejectedly. “Instead, I suppose I shall have to go to
prison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, in the château,” said Mme de Trélan encouragingly.
“And I will be your gaoler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He understood. A look of alarm came over his face.
“Oh no, Madame, that would never do! The Directory——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid that I care very little for the Directory,”
broke in the Duchesse calmly, beginning to unfasten the
fichu from her neck. “Now first, Monsieur, I am going
to tie this muslin of mine very tightly about you, for I
think there has been no bleeding for some time, and then
we must see whether you can get to your feet, and whether,
with my help, you can walk as far as the château.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And five minutes or so later, with infinite precautions,
the youth trying to put as little weight on a woman as he
need, and to stifle the expressions of pain that came to his
lips, they were actually progressing very slowly from the
Bosquet de Mercure into that of Ceres. And in the pillared
shrine of the goddess Mme de Trélan had a moment’s
impulse to instal her protégé, seeing his extreme pallor
and the possibility of his being unable to reach the house.
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
But the little temple was eminently unsuitable for a
hospital, she would find it very awkward to get away to
tend him there, and he would be liable to discovery. So,
since he assured her rather breathlessly that he was all
right, they went forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the edge of the great fountain, however, exposed
though it was in its open parterre, he was obliged to sit
down and rest a moment or two. The Duchesse sat
beside him with her arm round him, lest he should fall
backwards off the stone rim into the dark and viscous
water behind him. And he, his eyes on the great house,
seemed to be realising the extent of his prospective refuge.
“I could not see it properly last night,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Valentine told him not to talk. He did not altogether
obey her, and his intermittent remarks as they went
onwards in the growing light amid the increasing vociferations
of the thrushes were now and then unintelligible.
Once he called her “Marthe,” and then apologised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly there were no eyes to watch them at that early
hour save those of the birds, no place for them to watch
from but the overgrown thickets. And so Mme de Trélan
got Roland de Céligny unobserved into Mirabel by the
basement stairway at the back, and along the dark passages
to her room. By the time they reached her parlour he
was mute and unresisting, and when she had steered him
to the bed (left just as she had slipped out of it) and had
somehow assisted him on to it, her youthful visitor, as she
fully expected, quietly fainted away again.
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c8'>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>HIS SOJOURN THERE</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>When the <span class='it'>laitière</span> came at half-past six that morning she
was sorry to hear that Mme Vidal was indisposed, but not
ill-pleased to sell her, in consequence, a double portion of
milk. So indisposed indeed was the concierge that she
requested Toinon, when she returned to the village, to
get conveyed to Paris a note to her niece Mme Tessier,
asking the latter to make a few purchases and to visit her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sympathetic Toinon gone, Mme de Trélan went
back to her patient. Long before this he had come to
himself for the second time, and she had fed him with the
milk she had reserved for her morning coffee, in a spoon.
He took it drowsily, like a child, and dropped off to sleep
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought him asleep now when she came in, and went
about noiselessly putting the dark little bedroom to rights,
preoccupied all the time with one thought, this boy’s
safety. The thought divided itself into two parts; how
to secure proper attention for his wound, and how to get
the boy himself away without discovery. Her unpractised
investigation of his hurt had already led her to suppose
that it was a glancing flesh wound off the ribs, probably
not dangerous, save from the amount of blood he seemed
to have lost. Why he had risked coming by it she had
not even a guess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though she thought him asleep she saw, after a
minute or two, as she passed by the bed, that his eyes
were open and that he was looking at her. He was very
flushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there anything you want, mon enfant?” she asked,
stopping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He continued to look at her mutely, then made these
brief statements:
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Roland de Céligny. I ought not to have
come. Now I shall be endangering you. Madame, I
implore you to let me go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chut!” retorted Valentine, laying her hand for a
second on his forehead. “How could you go, even if I
would let you? There is no need, I assure you, to trouble
about me. Besides, why should I not care for a wounded
man whom I find in the garden. You are not a malefactor,
Monsieur de Céligny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mais si, Madame,” replied Roland earnestly. “In
intention, at least .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that is just what I am.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You
ought to give me up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we all did what we ought to do!” exclaimed Valentine
lightly, and stood looking down at him, convinced
now that that momentary likeness was a trick of the dawn,
some enchantment of the garden, anything but fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt that to ensure silence she ought to leave him;
unused as she was to caring for an injured man she was
certain that he ought not to talk. In romances the wounded
hero was always adjured not to do so, and the boy looked
feverish. But not to know a little more about him were
to waste the chance of arranging some plan which the
faithful Suzon’s arrival would bring her. So, contrary
to all romantic tradition, Valentine sat down by the bed
and said in a business-like way,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, Monsieur de Céligny, as shortly as possible, what
you came into the garden to do, and if you know anyone in
Paris with whom it would be safe to communicate. I ask
you this because I have a trusted friend coming to see me
to-day, and through her something might be arranged.
Your personal safety is the first thing to consider, your
wound—which I believe is not serious—the second.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have cousins in Paris,” said Roland. He gave their
address. “I was at their house for three or four days
before I came here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do they know where you are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will be very anxious about you, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” murmured he rather shamefacedly, and sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they likely to track you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so,” said the adventurer. “No, I do
not believe it possible.”
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the sentry saw you; fortunately it was too dark
to distinguish your face. They are sure to search again.
I think the moment has come, Monsieur de Céligny, if I
am to help you further, for you to tell me a little more.
You see that I am your friend, and that I am not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in
fear of the Directory. You need not name anyone unless
you wish, but I think you had better tell me for what
reason you were in the park of Mirabel last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” replied Roland with emotion, “after what
you have done for me I should indeed be foolish and
ungrateful if I kept back anything from you. I came to
Mirabel to find the hidden treasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchesse de Trélan stared at him. “But, my child,
there is no such thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the pillow the young man’s look said as politely
as possible, “How can you be sure of that, Madame la
concierge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have known the château for many years,” said
Valentine, “and I assure you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She broke off,
puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have seen a plan of its hiding-place,” said Roland
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you see such a thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was in Brittany with M. de——” some
remnant of caution checked him, “—with a Chouan leader.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Chouan leader had a plan of a treasure hidden in
Mirabel!” exclaimed Mirabel’s mistress, strongest amazement
in her tone. “What was his name—no, I will not
ask you that. Did he send you here, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Madame,” admitted Roland, with a return of
shamefacedness. “He will be very angry with me—if
ever I see him again.” He gave a second or two to inward
contemplation, presumably, of this anger, and went on,
“The money was hidden here during the Fronde by the
Duc of those days, but the paper describing its whereabouts
was stolen, and came into the hands of an old lady who was
dying in the next house to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to where we were. Our
aumônier went to see her, and she gave him the paper to
convey to the Duc de Trélan, who, I believe, is in England,
or somewhere of the sort. At any rate he is an émigré—as
I suppose you know, Madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine forced herself to remain quietly sitting there.
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
“Well?” she said, and her voice, from sheer self-restraint,
sounded quite stony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the aumônier brought it in to give to M. de
Kersaint, because he knew that the Marquis was a kinsman
of the Duc de Trélan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What name did you say?” asked Valentine, more
and more amazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Marquis de Kersaint,” replied Roland. Then he
stopped. “I did not mean to mention the name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De Kersaint—a kinsman!” exclaimed Valentine,
from whom all thoughts of encouraging prudence in the
fugitive were now miles away. “I never heard the name
in my life! A kinsman of——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Roland was staring at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, never mind,” said she. “We must keep to the
point, which is, how to get you away, Monsieur de Céligny.
You saw this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this extraordinary plan, then, and—since
you say that you were not sent—I assume that you thought
that you would like to come on your own account to hunt
for the treasure. Had you any accomplices?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in Paris,” replied Roland, reddening faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your cousins know nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I merely said that I was leaving Paris for the day
and might be back late. You see, Madame, I meant to
have got here earlier, but it was light so long. I only
had a sight of that plan for a moment,” confessed the
treasure-hunter with engaging candour, “yet I remember
that it looked as though there were an entrance from the
garden to a passage leading under the house to the banqueting
hall, I think. But I did not realise that the garden
was so large.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Valentine stared at him. It was making her
dizzy to learn these facts—if they were facts—about her
own house after all her years of acquaintance with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be crazy, my child,” she said conclusively,
“or the plan was a hoax. But to return to these cousins
of yours, and how to get you restored to them. The point
is whether it would be better to try to smuggle a surgeon
in to you, or to smuggle you out. And what to say to
them? It is not over safe to tell the exact truth in a
letter. It might endanger the bearer also. Let me
think.”
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her shapely, slightly roughened hand over her
eyes, and Roland gazed at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur de Céligny,” she said after a moment, uncovering
her eyes, “have you ever fought a duel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should you object to having come to the park of Mirabel
for that purpose last night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland took her meaning, with a little smile. “There
is nothing I should like better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the best I can devise for the moment. As I say,
it would not do for you to tell the truth in writing. If,
to-morrow night, you could walk with my assistance as
far as a little door in the park wall that I know of, and if
your cousins could procure, with all secrecy, for a carriage
to be there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You see, it will be impossible for you to
get out of the place you have so rashly entered save in
some such clandestine fashion, and even then any mischance——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mischance to me matters not, Madame!” cried the
young man. “But if it were to you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchesse de Trélan smiled. “Reassure yourself,
Monsieur de Céligny. No mischance is likely to come to me.
If you feel able I must urge you now to write a line to your
cousins about your duel. It might be thought a trap of
some kind if I wrote. They must see your hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fetched him pencil and paper, and together they
concocted a letter to his elderly kinsmen, she holding the
paper. At the end she fed him again, for the conversation
and the effort of writing had exhausted him rather alarmingly.
It was no more than was to be expected. But at
that price Valentine had the main threads of the affair
in her hands now.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In the early afternoon arrived, as she had been desired,
the faithful Tessier, with a basket containing medicaments
and comforts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew the place would not suit you, Madame,” she
said, almost as soon as she set foot inside the little parlour.
“Ah, I see that you are indeed indisposed!” For Mme
de Trélan, to give colour to her statement to Toinon, had
wrapped herself in a shawl.
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suzon, I was never better in my life,” said she, and
looked it. “But there is someone ill here. That was
really why I sent for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Someone—in there?” ejaculated Mme Tessier, pointing
to the bedroom door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a young man, suffering from a gunshot wound
in the side,” responded the Duchesse calmly. “You can
give me help and advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the moment Suzon looked little capable of either.
Her eyes turned wildly from Mme de Trélan to the bedroom
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—did he fall from heaven, or through the chimney?”
she managed to get out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither. I found him in the garden at three o’clock
this morning. He was shot by the guard last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suzon sat down heavily on a chair. “Mercy on us!
What is his name, Madame, his business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His name—no, I will not tell you his name. And as
for his business, suffice it to say that it has not succeeded.
I want to keep him here no longer than is necessary for
his wound, lest he should be discovered and taken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you yourself, Madame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My reputation, do you mean?” asked the Duchesse,
laughing. She seemed in a mood of unusual exhilaration.
“I think, at my age, that will take care of itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your safety is what I mean, Madame,” said Suzon
reproachfully. “You ought to give him up, whatever
he was doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is just what I am going to do—to his relations
if they will come and fetch him.” And Valentine explained
her plan. When she had heard it, poor Suzon, breathing
a sigh of relief at the prospect of getting rid of the refugee,
almost clamoured to take the compromising letter to its
destination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I think I had better see these gentlemen and
bring back the answer to-morrow,” she volunteered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly like to ask you to do that,” said Valentine,
hesitating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then how are you going to know, Madame, whether
the carriage will be there or not,” objected Mme Tessier.
“It will be difficult enough as it is to bring it all off without
a hitch. And I am only too anxious for him to be gone.
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
Cleaning day or visiting day, what might happen—Heaven
preserve us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My bedroom is not on show to the general public,”
observed Valentine lightly. “And I can always lock
Louise out.” (Louise commanded the brigade of cleaners.)
“However, I am not anxious to keep the boy, for his own
sake. Now, what have you brought me for him, Suzette?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme Tessier watched her as, alert and interested, she
unpacked the basket. Now and again there would peep
out, in this tragically fated lady, whom she worshipped
and protected with equal fervour—this lady who for all
her lifetime of authority was so wonderfully humble and
contented—some trait of those older days when her lightest
wish had been a command. Despite her extraordinary
consideration for others, and those her inferiors, she did
sometimes demand services without counting the cost,
and accept devotion as a right. And Suzon loved her
for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is excellent, ma fille,” said the Duchesse in a
moment, setting out Suzon’s purchases on the table. “I
think that as a reward I must tell you, after all, about
this young man’s errand—a wild-goose chase if ever there
was one. Did you ever hear, Suzon, from your grandfather,
of a treasure hidden in Mirabel from the time of the
Fronde?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, bless you, yes, Madame,” replied Suzon. “Grandpère
used often to talk of it. There were supposed to be
jewels too. But I never believed it myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine was taken aback at this unexpected reply.
“You did know of it! It is extraordinary that I should
be the last to hear of it, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in both their minds, as each guessed, was the
unuttered question, Had the Duc known of it too?
But for years now Mme Tessier had never mentioned
M. de Trélan unless the Duchesse did so first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very strange,” went on Mirabel’s mistress reflectively.
“And stranger still that the man who possesses
a plan of the spot where this treasure is supposed to be
hidden should be a Chouan leader calling himself—with
what truth I cannot tell—a kinsman of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the Duc’s.”
A swift, tiny flush ran over her face. “I have never heard
his name. I think it must be a false assertion.”
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is why the young man is here, then?”
interrupted Suzon despite herself. “—sent by this Chouan
to secure the treasure! He is a Royalist, therefore!—O,
Madame——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not <span class='it'>sent</span>, I gather,” corrected the Duchesse. “Yes,
a Royalist, a <span class='it'>collet noir</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A <span class='it'>collet noir</span>—one of those hotheads! And the guard—you
say they shot him! Did they not search for him?
Will they not search again? Really, Madame, I must say
it, your imprudence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The search, if you can call it so, is over,” said Mme
de Trélan with composure, opening a pot of jelly. “It was
very perfunctory last night, and little better this morning,
when the sergeant and three men came. I of course knew
nothing—may Heaven pardon me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven needs to watch over you!” murmured Suzon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They think he got away—the obvious conclusion.
So now we have nothing to do but to make that surmise a
fact.” Suddenly she turned her head. “What, in
heaven’s name, is the poor boy doing in there now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was singing; and as the two women went hastily in,
it was apparent that his choice was that gay little air,
<span class='it'>La Double Violette</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suzon,” said the Duchesse in alarm, after a moment,
“he is light-headed. Is he worse? What ought I to
do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect,” replied Mme Tessier, “that a surgeon would
say he should be bled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bled! when he has lost so much blood already!”</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>“Rossignol prend sa volée,</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Au château d’amour s’en va,”</span></p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>chanted Roland, more and more out of tune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, poor nightingale!” exclaimed Valentine, half
laughing. “ ‘Château d’amour,’ indeed!”</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>“Trouva la porte fermée,</span></p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>was the songster’s next equally appropriate announcement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go at once to the village and get a febrifuge of
some kind,” said Suzon, making for the door. “I will not
be long.”
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mme de Trélan was left, to be greeted with the
nightingale’s message:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>“Bonjour l’une, bonjour l’autre,</span></p>

<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Votre amant m’envoie vous dire</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Que vous ne l’oubliez pas!”</span></p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Child,” she said, sitting down and laying her hand
on the hot forehead, “you could put your strength to so
much better use!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at her voice or touch the minstrel suddenly ceased
his strain, while his fingers, moving over the bed, found and
closed on her other hand. Thereafter he was at least
quiet.
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c9'>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>HIS DEPARTURE THENCE</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Thus it was that Roland de Céligny’s exit from Mirabel
was not so speedily effected as his hostess had planned.
And without Suzon Tessier it is doubtful whether it would
have been effected at all. For if Mme de Trélan was cast
for the romantic part in this drama of deliverance, it was
Suzon who played the indispensable go-between with
MM. de Céligny <span class='it'>aînés</span>, she who brought in the additional
and choicer provisions required for the invalid, she who
supported, on cleaning-day, the fiction of Mme Vidal’s
not being able to leave her room, and personally enforced,
in consequence, a surprising quiet among the myrmidons
of Louise. But Roland hardly realised his debt to Mme
Tessier; the ardour of his gratitude glowed at the feet of
Mme de Vidal—as he persisted in calling her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But on the fourth evening he was well enough to go, the
two women thought; and, for his part, well enough to be
sorry to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been arranged that at ten o’clock a carriage should
be in waiting outside a certain little door in the park wall
at the end of the lime-tree avenue known as the Allée des
Soupirs—a door which the Duchesse had already investigated,
and from which, when she oiled the rusty bolts, she
had torn away in readiness the plastered ivy. This door
was some distance down the park, and, therefore, to
accustom him to the use of his legs, Valentine had caused
her patient to walk several times round the room with the
assistance of Suzon and herself. It was already getting
dark; Suzon had gone back to Paris, and, since Mme de
Trélan dared not have her patient in her living-room
in case of a surprise, she had taken her armchair into her
bedroom and ensconced him in it, to eat his supper before
he faced the journey to the door, and herself sat down to
bear him company.
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>And while he ate Roland talked; or, to be more accurate,
when he was not talking, he ate. Propped up with pillows
in his chair, bright-eyed, with a varying colour, he appeared,
as he was, excited, and not the less attractive for his condition.
His wound was not, Suzon said, doing very well,
but he seemed free from fever, and it was too dangerous for
him to stay longer. Both Valentine and he knew that.
So he utilised the last remaining half-hour in converse, and
not being of a suspicious nature, never considered that
this woman who was saving him could quite easily betray
him afterwards when she had gained from him all the
information she wanted, nor even that it might be worth
her while letting him slip for the sake of that information.
The concierge’s extraordinary kindness and generosity had
earned, besides his undying gratitude, his whole-hearted
confidence. Moreover, as he told himself, however she
came to her present position, it was not a position natural
to her. Apart from her voice, her bearing, what concierge
ever had filbert nails like that? Yes, Roland wished he
were not going out of Mirabel with the prospect of never
seeing its guardian again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he chatted unrestrainedly about the little band in
Brittany. Chiefly he dwelt upon M. de Kersaint, and
manifested astonishment when he learnt that his hostess
did not know of the heroic part that gentleman had played
in the great Austrian defeat at Rivoli two and a half years
ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget, Monsieur Roland,” observed Valentine,
smiling, “that I do not live in Royalist circles. But I
think I do remember hearing at the time that one of the
Austrian columns was commanded by a French émigré,
but I never learnt his name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was M. de Kersaint. He has the cross of Maria
Theresa for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! I am afraid the Directory would give him a
very different decoration if they had him in their hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not likely to have him there,” asserted Roland
confidently. “But I remember hearing M. de Brencourt
say that Masséna in particular—not to speak of General
Bonaparte——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whom did you say?” asked Valentine, struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Masséna. He came up during the night,
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
you know, to Joubert’s assistance, Bonaparte being of
course in supreme command——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” interrupted the Duchesse again, less interested
in the battle of Rivoli (on which this young man
seemed to be an expert) than in something else. “I mean—what
name—whom did you say you overheard? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
M. de Brencourt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland nodded. “The Comte de Brencourt is M. de
Kersaint’s second-in-command. He said that Masséna
was furious——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, what is he like, this M. de Brencourt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland, surprised, described him. “Why, do you know
him, Madame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It cannot be the same,” said Valentine hastily. “I did
not mean to interrupt you, Monsieur de Céligny. Go on,
pray, with what you were telling me about M. de Kersaint
and Rivoli.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she did not listen. Pictures were floating in her
head of her stay at Spa in 1787, of her first meeting at that
fashionable resort with the Comte de Brencourt, whose
admiration had almost amounted to persecution, who had
threatened once to shoot himself because of her coldness,
and who had followed her against her bidding to her
country house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the same man, of course. Dimly she heard about
Lucien and Artamène and the “Abbé,” of the disbanding,
of greater plans for the future, and it was not for some
moments that she came back entirely to her room and her
attractive refugee, and found that the young man, leaning
slightly forward in the big chair, was asking her a question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not think, Madame de Vidal, that you might
add to your never-to-be-forgotten kindness by telling me
in your turn, something about yourself? You—pardon
me—you are no concierge! You are as gently born as
I!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think so? Well, the world has been upside down
these ten years, has it not? Ten years ago—if you were
old enough then to give a thought to the future—you
would not have expected to grow up a house-breaker,
Monsieur Roland!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But from the way he looked at her then she could almost
see his young and romantic mind working, and probably
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
making up wild stories about her. She decided to present
him with one ready-made, and not so far from the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said quietly, “it is useless to deny that I am
gently born, but I trust that my employer, the Deputy
who has charge of the château, is not aware of the fact.
For him I am the aunt of his cousin, Mme Tessier. My
late husband, an émigré, died abroad, and I was obliged
to earn my living, like many a better woman. I used
to earn it by needlework; now I do so by looking after
Mirabel. There you have my history in the proverbial
nutshell. And now”—she glanced at the little clock on
the shelf, “it is nearly time to start for the Allée des
Soupirs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colour leapt into Roland’s face. “You have been
so divinely kind, Madame, that I dare ask one more kindness.
Something—the merest trifle—as a memento of
what indeed I shall need no memento to keep in lifelong
memory!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a long time since young men had asked Valentine
de Trélan for souvenirs. That they had asked in vain was
neither here nor there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my child,” she responded with a maternal air, “I
have nothing to give you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless you would like a
thimble or a pair of scissors!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like anything,” said the petitioner humbly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” said she, rising, “that what you would
like best would be some of this semi-mythical treasure.—Roland!”
she said, struck by a sudden thought, “promise
me that you will not come back after it when you are better!
Promise me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy had flushed with pleasure at the sound of his
unprefixed name. “Alas, the treasure will probably be
gone before I am well enough for that, Madame. The
Marquis de Kersaint will send somebody—but not one of
us. He said it was work for an older and wiser head, and
I suppose he was right. I suspect he will send M. de
Brencourt, if he can spare him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Valentine, and was silent all at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” went on the youth, unregarding, “if I am to
promise not to return, Madame de Vidal, you must give
me a remembrance of you to take away with me. Otherwise——”
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are threatening me,” observed Valentine,
recovering herself. “For my part I can ill spare my
thimble, but if it will prevent your climbing that wall
again—Stay, I believe I have something after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And going into the outer room she came back with the
locket she had found in the work table in her boudoir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you care for this, Monsieur de Céligny,” she said,
“you are welcome to it. It has no value. It was mine as
a girl, before my marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she need not have said that, for the V, which alone
stood out clearly among the twisted pearls and garnets of
the monogram, he could easily take for “Vidal.” Getting
with some difficulty to his feet the young man reverently
received the trinket, looked at it, and having kissed it
slipped the worn chain about his neck. Mme de Trélan
brought some garments from the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is really time to go, mon enfant. You will need all
your courage for the journey. Here is your hat; I
brought it in afterwards from the guardianship of the
statue; and you must put on this cloak, for it is raining
hard. All the better, for rain drowns noises—though I
hope there is no one to hear in any case. Now, you must
lean on me hard, for I am very strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was indeed raining from a light spring sky
which somehow concealed a moon. On the limes of the
Allée des Soupirs, when they got there, the drops pattered
heavily. The journey had been slow and trying, but at
last they reached the door. Roland, panting, leant
against the wall while Valentine opened it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was lucky that she had oiled bolts and hinges, for
even then it protested as she pulled at it. The last ivy
tendril gave. Mme de Trélan went through and heard
an unseen horse blow out its nostrils and a bit jingle, and
then saw two dim forms waiting in the lane. One of them
touched her on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is there?” asked an educated man’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just inside,” she answered. “Be quick, for he can
scarcely stand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men went through the door, and in a moment
Roland came out between them, stumbling a little but not
so spent that he did not try to stop as he passed her. His
supporters very properly would have none of this, but she
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
heard the boy’s low, broken words of gratitude and farewell
before the three had vanished in the shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to go in. And then the same man’s form
loomed through the darkness again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is for your inestimable services, and your discretion,
my good woman,” he whispered. “You can guess
whence it comes.” And, seizing one of her hands in the
obscurity, he thrust something into it and closed her fingers
round the gift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very shortly afterwards the Duchesse de Trélan stood
alone in the rain under the wet limes of the Allée des
Soupirs in her park of Mirabel. Her arm was lightened of
the burden she had supported down the avenue, but her
heart, although it knew a great relief, beat to an odd little
ache that was almost regret. And she stood there between
tears and laughter, because of what she held in her hand
as an exchange for Roland de Céligny—a considerable
bundle of assignats.
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c10'>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE KNIGHT’S MOVE</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>May had given place to June before Valentine de Trélan
had quite got accustomed to the departure of the handsome
boy whose presence had been such an anxiety and yet
such a pleasure to her. The five thousand francs which
she had in his place—not nearly so large a sum as it appeared
owing to the enormous depreciation of paper money under
the incapable rule of the Five Kings—she had at first
thought of returning to his relatives by Suzon Tessier.
But Suzon, by pretending to wish for her own sake to
avoid further intercourse with that house, had persuaded
the Duchesse to keep their bounty, at least for the present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the evening when she had wept under her husband’s
portrait Valentine had never again felt any disposition
to tears. Reaction had come after that outburst.
If Gaston were alive—and she could not rid herself of the
conviction that he was—it was difficult not to draw the
conclusion that he was indifferent to her fate. Seven
years, and no sign! Then she told herself again, as she had
so often done, that her letters had never reached him,
that he had not the slightest reason for supposing her to be
still in life, since everybody of her world who had survived
the tempest believed her murdered, that she had no evidence
of his not having made enquiries after her, or unsuccessful
efforts to find her. Only of a successful effort
would she have heard. But none of these reasoned considerations
could remove the sting of that long silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, if Gaston were suddenly to appear before her, would
she be able to greet him with that unconcern which she
had almost persuaded herself that she felt—and that she
ought to feel? She knew she would not. Down in the
depths of her soul all the time was the emotion which had
pierced her in the picture-gallery—the intense longing to
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
see him again. It was Mirabel which had first made her
conscious of this longing, and it was Mirabel which had
insensibly fed it. And there were times when she cursed
the impulse which had brought her here, for under the
crust of indifference which she had hoped was forming
over her heart she could feel the stirring of that desire,
growing daily not less strong, but stronger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then one day it occurred to her that if this Chouan
chief of Roland de Céligny’s spoke of writing to the Duc
de Trélan about the treasure he must know, or think he
knew, Gaston’s whereabouts. More, if he were to send
someone to Mirabel after the hoard, as Roland had appeared
to think certain, she might communicate at least with
this self-styled kinsman of her husband’s by his emissary,
whoever he were. Yes, even if he were the Comte de
Brencourt; for although that mad passion of his must
be many times dead after all these years—and, perhaps,
just because of its death—he would surely bear a letter
for her back to Brittany .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even as Roland might have
done, had she thought of it in time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This idea grew in her to an impatience for the coming
of the next treasure-seeker. But June went on, and he
did not come. Paris celebrated (with insufficient enthusiasm
to please the Government) the obsequies of the envoys
murdered at Rastadt; commerce continued to decline,
discontent and lethargy to become more marked, and
Republican feelings suffered outrage at the first performances
of the opera of <span class='it'>Adrien</span>, wherein the stage emperor
made his entry with undue pomp. On the eighteenth came
a minor revolution, the <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> of the 30th Prairial,
with a consequent change of ministry. Valentine heard
of it with calm, and June slid presently into July.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Among the few sightseers who passed the sentry on
the 20th of Messidor, a visiting day, was one who, though
M. Thibault was too much engrossed in conversation to
observe it, never entered the château at all, but strolled
round to the garden front. There was nothing to prevent
this, though it was hardly ever done. The really remarkable
fact about this enterprising visitor was that he did
not reappear again at leaving time; but this also
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
passed without remark. Yet he had not vanished into
space; he was seated, when twilight came, in that
very grotto of Latona whose spring had refreshed Roland,
waiting with some impatience for completer darkness.
He had already seen as much of the garden front of Mirabel
as he wished—a window on the ground-floor with a badly-broken
shutter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Problems connected with the recruiting and organisation
of Finistère had kept the Comte de Brencourt longer in
Brittany than the Marquis de Kersaint had bargained for,
but he was here at last on his mission. Since a detail of
the ancient plan had proved susceptible of two interpretations,
he hoped to-night to make a preliminary search;
after which he would arrange his plan of campaign with
the Royalist agents in Paris with whom he was in touch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than the question of his difficult enterprise, however,
was occupying M. de Brencourt’s mind as he sat in
that fantastic relic of the dead and gone world of which
he also was a survival. It was impossible to be at Mirabel,
even for the first time in his life, without thinking of Mme
de Trélan, and, as his refuge darkened, he found himself
thinking of little else, and of the extraordinary chance
which had thrown her tragic and sacred shadow across
his path again. On the windings of that chance Artus
de Brencourt, while he waited, had time to meditate
profoundly, and sitting there in the July twilight, his chin
on his hand, staring at the arbutus which almost blocked
the entrance to the grotto, he was asking himself two
questions. Why had the Marquis de Kersaint, that kinsman
of the Duc de Trélan’s, ceased, after that night at
Hennebont, to wear his emerald signet ring; and why had
that ring borne, as he then distinctly saw for the first
time, the phoenix of the Saint-Chamans? For M. de
Kersaint had stated that he was a connection of that house
by marriage only. That he was a connection seemed
obvious from the minute instructions he had been able to
give M. de Brencourt on the topography of Mirabel. This
business of the ring intrigued the Comte not a little.
He was quite conversant with the device of the great
house of Trélan, and over the troop of strange surmises
born of the presence of that device on M. de Kersaint’s
finger and its abrupt disappearance he was still frowning
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
when the time came for him to make his stealthy entrance
into Mirabel.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>For all that she had half looked for his arrival, it was
chance, of a kind, that directed the Duchesse de Trélan’s
steps that evening towards the invader; chance that caused
her to have left the special key in the door of the portrait
gallery; chance that made her set out, somewhat unnecessarily,
to fetch it before she retired for the night—and
chance that led her returning footsteps through the
great dark spaces of the Salle Verte .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to hear, as she
passed along between the pillars and the wall, a slight
muffled noise of tapping—coming whence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine stopped dead, lamp in hand. The gentle
and recurrent sound did not come from the banqueting
hall itself, that was plain. From the “sallette,” then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>No more than when she had searched the garden for a
possible malefactor and found Roland did she dream of
danger to herself, though had she paused to think of it
she might have guessed that the intruder would be armed,
and, if surprised, might use his weapon. She walked back
and softly opened the door of the sallette; her surmise
was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her own lamp cast in its beams, but there was light
there already—a lantern standing on the floor, making a
pool of radiance by the feet of a man who stood in front
of the great hearth with his back to her. In this pool,
pinned down by the lantern, was an outspread sheet of
paper, a plan of some sort. Her eyes were able to take
in these details before the man, turning quickly, saw her
standing there with her lamp. His one hand went to his
breast, doubtless in search of a weapon, but he never
produced it, and the tool which he held in the other fell
clattering to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>God in Heaven!</span>” he exclaimed sharply, and recoiled
a step or two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it?” asked Valentine a little uncertainly.
“Is it—is it Monsieur de Brencourt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intruder did not answer—did not even seem to
hear her question. He remained literally as if turned to
stone, his eyes burning cavernously in his pale face, on
which the upcast light of the lantern at his feet, crossing
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
with that of Valentine’s lamp, cast odd shadows. After
a moment, moving like a man half stunned from a fall, he
came a little towards her. Then he stopped again, and
passed his hand over his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That light dazzles me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you are not real!” he
muttered. Stooping, he picked up his own lantern, and
held it high in a hand that shook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it really Madame de Trélan?” he asked huskily.
“Was it untrue then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. September .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. La Force?—Speak,
Duchesse, for God’s sake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the matter of astonishment Valentine had the advantage
of him, since she had been led to think his coming
possible. But she too was shaken by the encounter, the
first with anyone of her own world who had known her,
for seven long years. And she found herself unable to do
more than give a sort of pale acquiescence to his agitated
questions by bending her head and saying, “Yes, it was
untrue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is she!” said de Brencourt to himself, his harsh
features showing his profound emotion. Suddenly he
lowered his lantern. “Give me your lamp, Duchesse, and
sit down and tell me—tell me, unless I am to take leave
of my senses, how it comes about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where you have
been all these years .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what you are doing now? My
God, to think—Permit me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He deposited his own lantern on the floor and took the
lamp from her unresisting grasp, looking round the
plundered sallette in vain for something to put it on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me back the lamp, Monsieur le Comte,” said
Valentine, finding speech. “We cannot talk here. Let
us go to my room. It is safer also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a room here?” he exclaimed. “You are
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” For the first time he seemed to become aware
of her attire, so different from anything which he had ever
seen her wear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held out her hand for the lamp. “Come,” she said,
“unless your business here——” She indicated the tool
and the map.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that can wait now!” said the treasure-hunter
with an accent of scorn. He picked up the chisel and the
plan and followed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, beneath the cavernous half-seen gilding of the great
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
Salle Verte, down the basement stairs and along the bare
prison-like corridor below, carrying the lamp, went the
Duchesse de Trélan in her respectable black dress and fichu,
and behind her walked, still half stupefied, the man who
had once made such persistent and unavailing love to her.
And it was in this guise, very exactly that of a thief in the
night, that the Comte de Brencourt came for the first time
to her house of Mirabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought penetrated his stupor with some force
during the transit. For, once arrived at Valentine’s little
parlour, as she put down the lamp on the table he said
abruptly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never been in Mirabel in my life. And I find
you here to greet me!” He gave a sudden laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine did not answer. She was much more moved
than she wished to betray. She sat down in a chair near
the table and motioned to him to do the same. But he
put his hands on the table and remained leaning over it,
staring at her with a half-wild eagerness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Are</span> you alive, Duchesse? Or am I dead, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Duchesse is not alive,” responded Valentine with
a faint smile. “You are speaking to Madame Vidal, the
concierge of Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” exclaimed the Comte de Brencourt,
springing upright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How else do you suppose I could be here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are jesting!” cried he, still incredulous. “You
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a concierge! Does no one know you?
Then you are poor—in want! Madame, Madame! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine lifted a hand. “Please, Monsieur de Brencourt,
do not agitate yourself! I am not in want. There is
no one left at Mirabel to recognise me—my portrait had
a pike put through it. I came of my own free will, and I
am not unhappy here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this, as if it were the most stunning news of all, he
did, perhaps unconsciously, subside into a chair, and,
leaning his elbows on the table, took his head between
his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me what happened?” he said after a moment.
And Mme de Trélan told him, shortly, the history of those
seven years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody thinks that I was killed,” she finished.
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so,” said he without moving. “I thought
so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God pity me, I have carried that picture of your
death about with me all these years. Oh, why did you
not let me into the secret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him with a sort of maternal regret, a
kinder look indeed, had he but met it, than he had ever
won from her during all the period of his fruitless passion.
“In the beginning I could tell no one, lest I should endanger
the Tessiers. I disappeared, Comte, without exactly
intending it. In the end I was glad to disappear. No
one but Mme Tessier knows to this hour of my identity;
I do not mean anyone to know. Believe me, I have not
been unhappy with these good friends of mine. After
being twice so near death, to see the sky and the green leaves
in the spring, to know affection, as I have known it, and
faithfulness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I am sorry if I have caused you so
long a pain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I had no news of you—for all I knew
you had gone the same road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I nearly did—in another way,” said the Comte briefly,
raising his head. He drew a deep breath and gazed at
her anew. “Do you know, Duchesse, that this is like—No,
I cannot yet grasp that this is you, Valentine de
Trélan, not only alive, but in this mean room, this bourgeois
dress——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She interrupted him with a warning. “Comte, this
mean room of mine is not too safe a shelter for you!
And how did you get into Mirabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Plainly this subject had ceased to interest him for the
moment, yet he answered that it were better for her not
to know, adding, “But you do not ask me why you found
me where you did?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Valentine composedly. “I know why you
broke in. You are come, are you not, on behalf of the
Marquis de Kersaint, to secure the treasure supposed to
have been hidden in the château during the time of the
Fronde?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again M. de Brencourt stared at her. “Are you a
witch, Madame, or has some Royalist agent——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither,” said she smiling. “It is no mystery how
I know. You have been preceded in your quest here,
Monsieur de Brencourt. Let me tell you of the doings of
a very rash young man.”
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>And astonished, annoyed, but half envious in the end
(for had she not nursed the boy for four days) the Comte
de Brencourt listened. But Valentine had to hear some
very trenchant comments on her protégé’s insane proceedings—so
her hearer characterised them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where is the treasure really supposed to be?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As far as can be made out,” said her guest, “behind
the great hearth, under that curious sort of gallery, in the
room where you found me.—Duchesse, I should perhaps
ask your permission for my work there; indeed, should I
find anything, what right have I to take it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The right of conquest,” answered Valentine. “But,
as for my permission, if I thought that withholding it
would keep you from going on with your search, I
believe I would withhold it. You risk your life,
Monsieur de Brencourt—or at least your liberty. Is it
worth it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His look said as plainly as speech, “So you do care a
little for my life—even for my liberty,” but what he
replied was, “The King’s cause in Finistère is in desperate
need of money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your leader is determined to secure it,” finished
Valentine. She went on, “Who is this Marquis de Kersaint
who .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who sent you?” It was not the way in
which she had meant to end the sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her question had rung in the Comte de Brencourt’s
own head pretty often of late. If he could have answered
it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. de Kersaint, Madame, as his ardent admirer, young
de Céligny, will probably have told you, is the émigré who
commanded that forlorn hope of an Austrian column at
Rivoli. He had been in Imperial service, I believe, for
some years, but left it at Campoformio. Monseigneur le
Comte d’Artois and his council offered him the post of
organising Finistère, where he will, if all goes well, be the
general commanding for the King this summer. I was
assigned to him as his second-in-command and came
over to Brittany with him in January. I know no more
of his personal history than that—except that all his
family, so I understand, perished in the massacres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a little pause, and Valentine, with an effort,
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
said, “I hear that in addition he calls himself a kinsman of
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my husband’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte made her a little bow. “He does claim that
honour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blood mounted to Mme de Trélan’s cheek, but she
took no notice of his tone, somewhat at variance with the
phrase he used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not remember ever having heard his name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” she went on, “as his kinship is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. quite
possible .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I shall ask you, Monsieur de Brencourt,
to do me a favour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A favour! You have only to ask, Duchesse.” But
he bit his lip; for he feared what the request might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is,” said Valentine, looking down, “a certain
family matter on which I should be glad of information.
It is possible that M. de Kersaint can supply this. I will,
therefore, write him a letter, and ask you to be good enough
to convey it to him when you return, Comte. Will you
do this for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any least service that I can render you, Madame——”
said the Comte, but rather formally this time. His brain
was still dazed with shock, but it was beginning to wake
to other activities, and he suddenly saw with immense
distaste a picture of himself delivering a letter from this
woman, loved and mourned and now given back to life,
into the hand of the man who wore the crest of the house
of Trélan, who knew Mirabel so well, who had been so
agitated at the mention of her death.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do not, Duchesse,” he continued hastily, “do
not give me the letter till I have finished or all but finished
my quest, for, should I have the mischance to be taken
with it on me, you will involve yourself—involve us all,”
he added, guessing that any threat of danger to herself
alone would probably go unregarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine bent her head. “Yes, I understand. And I
thank you, Comte. How long will your investigations
take you, do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the getting the gold away that will be the difficulty,”
replied the adventurer. “When I have satisfactorily
located it I shall concert measures with an agent
in Paris. See, Madame, here is a copy of the original
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
plan. But I fear it will not mean much to you, for steps
have been taken to render it unintelligible to anybody else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke truth, for of the scrawl now under her eyes
Valentine could make nothing. Yet she kept her gaze
long on it, making up her mind to do a thing she shrank
from, with this man of all others, and that was, to bring
her husband’s name into the conversation once more.
For the Comte had been with this “kinsman”; he might
even conceivably have heard something himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I understand,” she began, her head still bent over
the plan, “that M. de Kersaint communicated with my .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
with the Duc de Trélan before undertaking this search?
M. de Céligny said something about such a project.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied M. de Brencourt sharply. “No, there is
nothing of M. de Trélan in this. M. de Kersaint soon
abandoned that idea. He had to dispense with his kinsman’s
authorisation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He could not, perhaps, get into touch with the Duc?”
suggested Valentine faintly. Oh, how she hated this!
Yet he might hold some clue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the Comte again. “He judged it to be
impracticable, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Duc is no longer in England, perhaps?” pursued
Valentine, in torture at having to show him that she
herself did not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Madame, not in England, nor——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped abruptly. As a man who is fording a
river may come unexpectedly on a deep and eddying
current that threatens his balance, so did Artus de Brencourt
find himself losing foothold in the wholly unlooked for
temptation which suddenly assailed him. Could it be
blamed, the lie which should rid this beloved lady of the
ghost of that worthless husband who had left her to this,
the husband who in effect had been dead to her for years—and
who probably really was dead by this time? For
those suspicions as to de Kersaint’s identity were absurd.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And though it was unpremeditated, nothing could have
served him better than his hesitation. The Duchesse’s
eyes were on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not be afraid to speak, Monsieur de Brencourt,”
she said, slowly turning ashy pale. “If you mean that
the Duc is dead—tell me so!”
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>How could he resist the statement, put into his very
mouth like that? Once again those arguments flashed
past him: nothing had been heard of de Trélan for years,
the Marquis had <span class='it'>not</span> communicated with him—and as for
those surmises about de Kersaint himself, which till this
moment he had done nothing but encourage, he mentally
stamped on them. Then, taking a long breath, he let
himself be sucked down, dizzy but open-eyed, into the
torrent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I regret to be so fatal a messenger,”
was all he said, and bent his head.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>At least he would not look at her to see how his arrow
had sped. He heard her catch her breath, heard her rise
from her place opposite him at the table and go away.
Glancing up, after a moment, he saw her on the edge of
the circle of lamplight, leaning against the high shuttered
window, her hands over her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, after the stroke he had dealt her, it were the part
of a gentleman to leave her. Even though her husband
were nothing to her now, there was shock in the news.
De Brencourt was very conscious of it, but the circumstances
were exceptional, for he stood in peril of never
seeing her again. And now, perhaps, after these wasted,
unhappy years she would listen to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up and went towards her, but something in her
attitude or in his own soul restrained him from speaking
to her just then. He paused, stood looking desperately
at her stricken figure for a moment, then, going back to his
former place at the table, buried his face in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a little he heard her voice say, falteringly, from
where she was:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know any details, Monsieur le Comte—any
place .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when it was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his head but did not look at her. “No,” he
said slowly, gripping his hands together before him on
the table. “M. de Kersaint said no more than this, that
it was useless to write to the Duc de Trélan, because he
had just heard that he was dead—had been dead .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
some time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, at the repetition of that word “dead” he heard
her catch her breath again, he felt as though he were
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
bludgeoning her. But no—it was only a surgical operation
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and better so for her. The man he was murdering
was dead already. And it was too late to go back now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know how M. de Kersaint was aware of this,”
he went on. “He keeps his own counsel always. But
that is what he said, Madame. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He
tried to add some formal words of sympathy, but that
falsehood would not come, and he remained staring before
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I must know more!” said the Duchesse to herself
in a quick, breathless voice. “He will know, this M. de
Kersaint, this kinsman. Oh, I must write to him at once—before
you go, even, Comte!” She put her hand to her
head. “Where—how shall I address the letter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw that he must give a direction that would never
find its destination. How unexpectedly dark and tortuous
it was beginning to be, this path! Suddenly realising
that he was seated while she was standing he got up, and
for the first time since the utterance of his lie, looked her
in the face for a second. But he could not bear the sight,
and it was with downcast gaze that he responded,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be better for me to take the letter myself,
Madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I cannot wait .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” she answered faintly, so
faintly that he saw she was on the point of swooning.
He sprang round the table to her, and catching her in his
arms held her a second or two. The scarf had fallen from
her hair, and her head, grey and golden, rested against
his shoulder. Her eyes were shut, but he did not think
she had quite lost consciousness, or the kiss, reverent as
it was, which he put on that pathetic hair might have
found another goal, for his heart was beating furiously.
Then he lowered her into a chair, looked round for water,
and, seeing a pitcher and a cup, poured some out with
shaking hands and held it to her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right; the Duchesse had not lost consciousness
entirely. She drank some water, contrived to thank him,
and put her head back against the chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you better? Are you better?” he got out.
(“Brute, brute, brute!” he said to himself. But he was
not repentant.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were right to tell me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I asked you,” said she
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
almost inaudibly. A little colour was creeping back to
her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited a moment, gave her the cup again, gently
took one hand when she had finished, and gently rubbed it.
“And now that I have told you—Valentine, my only
love, I have been faithful to your memory all these years—now
that I have told you, you will let me take you
away from this dreadful place, this intolerable existence,
for ever. Valentine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Valentine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was at her feet now, clutching at the hand he had
been chafing, breathless, almost sobbing in the extremity
of his pleading:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Valentine, I implore you! It breaks my heart to see
you here! Come with me; be my wife! let us take what
remains to us in this sorry world! And if I speak so soon,
when my hand has just dealt you this blow, it is because
the time is so short, as you know. Indeed, I would not
press you for an answer now, even after all these years,
but that we are in the midst of perils. Say you forgive
my importunity—and say you will come with me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gently withdrew her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Comte,” she said with an effort, “I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I thank you,
but it could not be. I am an old woman now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
thank you, I thank you indeed for your faithfulness, but
I could not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least then, let me take you away as a brother might!
You cannot remain here—it is impossible to leave you to
this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will have enough to do,” said she, with a tremor
of the lips, “to get your gold away without encumbering
yourself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with a sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse the gold!” answered the Comte de Brencourt.
“No, after all, it brought me here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had got to his feet and stood looking down at her,
his eyes kindling. Then he made a great effort over
himself, and, stooping, took her hand and kissed it as he
might have done amid the gaieties where first he
met her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow night I will come again for an answer,
Duchesse. I will leave you now; I have given you, I
know, a very great shock. And I regret .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Again the
words stuck. “You must forgive me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And, lest you
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
should be anxious, I will not return to the sallette to-night.
Indeed, I think it must be getting near dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have given you my answer, Monsieur de Brencourt,”
repeated Valentine. There were black rings under her
eyes. “Believe me, I do appreciate your devotion. If I
could accept, I would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot take that answer,” said Artus de Brencourt
gravely. “But I will take an assurance that when you
have duly mourned the man to whom you have been so
nobly faithful .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that then, even if I have to wait a
year, two years——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can give you no hope,” she said once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not love me, Madame, that I have always
known. But all I ask is the right to be spent in your
service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had rather, Comte, that you were spent in a
worthier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made a gesture. “There exists no worthier,” he
said with quiet conviction, and bowing, went towards the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at the door he paused. “One thing more, Duchesse.
Since I would sooner die a thousand deaths than implicate
you in this attempt of M. de Kersaint’s, I wish to say that
should any mischance happen to me within these walls,
you may be well assured that I shall give no sign of ever
having seen you before. And you, Duchesse—for your
own sake, not for mine—will do the same by me, will you
not? Promise me that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half by gesture, for speech was getting beyond her, she
promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have the honour to take leave of you,” said the Comte
de Brencourt, and he went out.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>There was night in Mirabel—cold night and loneliness.
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c11'>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>CHECK TO THE KNIGHT</h3>

<p class='noindent'>It is doubtful if the Comte de Brencourt realised how his
false tidings about her husband would sweep out of Mme
de Trélan’s head almost all thought of himself, his proximity
and his enterprise; and quite certain that he would not
have been pleased had he known where she spent the greater
part of the following morning. For she had deliberately
gone up to a part of the château which she had not yet
entered, a part shut to visitors—the Duc’s private apartments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stripped, dusty, neglected, they were yet the rooms which
Gaston had inhabited, and she wandered there too miserable,
too self-reproachful even for weeping. <span class='it'>Mort!</span> the
word with its hollow vowel seemed to go echoing through
the emptiness that had once been so different. No chance
now of reconciliation; no chance of that ultimate meeting
somewhere, somehow, to the hope of which, in spite of
herself, she knew at last that she had been desperately
clinging—which had even, perhaps unknown to her, been
the determining factor in her acceptance of the post at
Mirabel. Whatever unsubstantial edifice she had been
rearing was all in ruins now, and neither in pride and
resentment, nor in the love that forgives everything, could
they meet again on earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now she knew the truth: she had always loved him,
she always would. And since, in its own surroundings,
there was not a single possession of his remaining, she went
to the Galerie de Psyché, and, under the paintings of that
wife of fable who also lost her mate, she knelt down by
Gaston’s beautiful escritoire, and bowing her head upon it,
kissed the place on the tortoiseshell where his hand had
used to rest. He was dead—so what did it matter that he
had long ceased to love her? He was dead; he was hers
now; she could love for both.
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It was neither a cleaning nor a visiting day, and Valentine
could not be too thankful that, with these tidings fresh
upon her heart, she would not be obliged to act just yet the
intolerable part she had so lightly taken up. But, to her
utter dismay, she heard, about two o’clock in the afternoon,
voices on the steps leading down to her room, and then the
sound of the entrance door opening, which showed that the
arrivals must include her master Camain, who now used the
key he had had, it appeared, all the time. And when
Valentine went out unwillingly into the passage she found
him in the midst of a whole cortège of visitors, mostly
feminine. Hanging on to his arm was a pretty, plump
woman of about thirty-five, whom she recognised at once
from the frequent prints of her in Paris. It was Rose
Dufour, the actress of the Ambigu-Comique.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A violent gust of repulsion went through the Duchesse
de Trélan. True, she had never been able to believe
that her husband had really admired Mlle Dufour, but nine
or ten years ago rumour had certainly linked their names
for a space, and to see her in person to-day, of all days .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, here is our good friend, Mme Vidal!” said Camain,
advancing. “Rose, if you wish to leave your wrap in her
care——” And without waiting for permission he removed
from the nymph’s very scantily attired shoulders a handsome
pelisse of violet satin edged with ermine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God, Camain, do you want me to die of cold
in your old tomb of a château!” exclaimed she, snatching
at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it is true that you will not be suffocated without
it. You might almost as well have nothing on,” observed
her admirer frankly, looking at her transparent white
muslin gown of classic cut, worn slightly damp, according
to the insane fashion of the day, to make it cling. Even
Mlle Dufour’s arms were bare to the shoulder, for the
actress was not of those who had to endure the accusation
launched at the wearers of sleeves, that they feared to
show those members. And her mythological garb, slit
for a considerable distance up the side, revealed the
golden fastenings of the buskin clambering half-way up
her leg, where a gilded acorn clasped them. For that
reason, presumably, she was not wearing, like one of her
companions, a jewelled thong around her ankle. But
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
upon her fair coiffure—probably a wig, for which the rage
was extreme—rose a confection of lilac crêpe, adorned
with two rows of pearls and surmounted by a rose and a
pansy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine had turned her back, pretending to be busy.
For nothing on earth would she touch any of that creature’s
belongings! However, the dispute about the pelisse
resolved itself into the lady’s decreeing that her swain
should carry it over his arm, lest she should wish to resume
it, and presently the whole party, laughing and talking,
swept up the stairway to the ground floor. Mme de Trélan,
conscious of jangled nerves, would fain have stayed behind,
but Camain insisted on her accompanying them, as was
indeed her duty. He did not present her to his mistress,
but his affability stopped short only of that mark of
distinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the great Salle Verte, for which they presently made,
he acted showman, while many remarks were passed on its
size and decorations, and surmises made as to what scenes
(“orgies,” one of the male members of the party termed
them) had occurred in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there is an inner room, somewhat curious,” said
the Deputy. “It was designed, I believe, to be a sort of
retreat for the prince—since the château, as I daresay
you know, was originally built for King François I. It is
worth looking at, Mesdames.” So the company obediently
followed him along the Salle Verte.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine was conscious of a violent wish that they
should not enter the sallette. Till this moment she had
been too much absorbed in the thought of her dead husband
to give much consideration to the Comte de Brencourt
and his doings. Now, although she knew that he had
not attacked the masonry, and although he would surely
not be so rash as to attempt anything in daylight, she
had a premonition of disaster. But Camain waved his
hand towards the door, and there was nothing for it but
to open it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, to Mme de Trélan’s great relief—for she
had somehow, against her better sense, expected to see de
Brencourt standing where she had found him last night—the
sallette was empty. And the company were called
on by the Deputy to admire the <span class='it'>cheminée royale</span>, with its
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
carving of Apollo and Daphne, and its nymph and pipe-playing
satyr on either side, but some of the ladies, unversed
in mythological lore, despite their present attire, were
intrigued by the main subject, and among these was the
Citoyenne Dufour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth is happening to that woman, Camain?”
she demanded. “Her arms are sprouting at the ends.
And who is the man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, ma belle,” responded her admirer, “is the
nymph Daphne, turning into a laurel to escape the attentions
of the god Apollo—a pretty prudery not likely, I
fancy, to find many imitators in these days, eh, ladies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Violent protests from the ladies of the party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, oh, Citizen Deputy, you have left some fleur-de-lys
on the wall!” observed one of them. “Is that to be
on the safe side—in case a Bourbon should return?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fleur-de-lys? Nonsense!” returned M. Camain,
putting up his spy-glass to look at the poor scorched remnant
of tapestry hanging there. “Those things you see
round that bit of border are .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. humming-birds, heraldic
humming-birds!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much laughter greeted this sally. “And what is this
queer long beast over the hearth?” demanded another
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a crown on its head, too! Oh fie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not, at any rate,” said one of the two youngish
men of the party, in the extraordinary lisp cultivated by
the would-be fashionable, “the strange fowl to whose nest
some one has set fire just as she was going to lay, which
we saw in the Salle Verte!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it went on, the flow of humour; and after visiting
most of the apartments on the first floor, where M. Camain
tripped badly as an expositor of the story of Psyche, and
where Valentine’s own apartments, though arousing
much interest, were voted horribly old-fashioned in
decoration, they came to the second, to the door of the
locked gallery with the china and portraits. Mme de
Trélan had hoped that she might have been spared that—for
how should she look upon that portrait in primrose
satin to-day?—and sick at heart as never before, she had
contrived to trail behind. She heard Camain’s voice
explaining what was in the room while he waited for her
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
to unlock the door. Then she realised that the key, being
a special one, was not on the concierge’s bunch, and that
she had in consequence forgotten to bring it with her.
She came forward and said so. “But I will go and fetch
it instantly, Monsieur le Député.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do, pray,—though I regret to put you to the trouble,”
said her employer. “Meanwhile, ladies, come out on
to this balcony, and you will see——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine hastened down the nearest stairs. Better
to get it over as soon as possible, the visit to that room,
for it had to be gone through with, and she had no one
but herself to thank for that fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had come down a minor staircase which deposited
her at some distance from her own quarters, and having
arrived on the basement floor she began to run, for she
was still as light-footed as a girl, and she had a constitutional
dislike, for all her upbringing, to keeping people
waiting. And thus, round a corner, she almost collided
with a man hastening in the opposite direction. A second
of stupefaction, and she saw that it was the Comte de
Brencourt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” she stammered out. “M. le Comte—what
madness! Camain is here himself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know!” returned he rather breathlessly. “They
are after me—never mind what happened—a folly of
my own. I am trying to get as far away from your rooms
as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But for God’s sake go back there!” said the Duchesse,
seizing hold of his arm, and all but pushing him. “Go
to my room—you will be safe there. They will not go in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” he exclaimed. “The last thing I should
do—compromise you in this affair!” And breaking
away from her he disappeared without another word,
and was out of sight or hearing before she could even
think of some spot in which he could hide. And since
her quick wit told her that any delay in returning with the
key might lead to Camain himself descending to investigate,
she ran on to her little parlour, snatched it up and set off
again with all haste. Terrible though it was to leave the
Comte to his fate, or at least to his own devices—for she
heard no sounds of pursuit yet—it was out of her power
to help him now.
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>From what she caught, as she returned to the little
group of persons on the second floor, it seemed that Camain
had been singing her praises in her absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid that you have hurried, Madame Vidal,”
he said in a tone of concern as he took the key from her.
She was indeed very obviously out of breath. “You
should not have done so. These ladies seized the opportunity
of taking a breath of air on the balcony, and having
a peep from there at the park, which they tell me I ought
to keep in better order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, Monsieur le Député,” put in one of the critics
in an affected voice, “you ought to be scolded! It
seems, as far as one can judge from up here, to be in the
state of the tangled wood which surrounded the castle of
the Sleeping Beauty.” She pulled her gauze scarf about
her with a still more affected air, acquired with a good
deal of pains above her husband’s shop, and the five blue
feathers in her turban quivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that remark, Madame Constant,” said the
Deputy, stooping and fitting the key into the lock, “gives
me an opening, does it not, for a pretty speech about the
Sleeping Beauty herself? However, Mme Vidal doesn’t
like pretty speeches, so I won’t make it.” He opened the
door, invited the ladies to enter, and after casting upon
Valentine a glance which could only be described as ogling,
followed the bevy, who had already fluttered in with
exclamations—two of them also casting glances of another
nature upon the concierge as they passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme de Trélan, every sense on the alert, remained
outside. Dared she run down the stairs again, and
could she do any good if she did? She had not long to
hesitate, for in an instant Camain’s voice was heard summoning
her within, and she obeyed, anxiety as to what
was going forward downstairs swallowing for the moment
every other feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might show these gentlemen the pictures, Madame
Vidal,” said her master, looking up from his favourite
Sèvres. And as the three men of the party attached
themselves to her, the Duchesse began to move slowly
along the line of Trélans, starting as far as possible from
her husband’s portrait. She heard, before beginning
her own unwilling exposition, Camain saying, “You
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
see this plate, ladies; I believe it was one of a service
painted for the late Duchesse on her marriage.” And
she guessed to what he was directing the attention of
those fair and envious vulgarians, to the plate of green
Sèvres with the alternate medallions of cherubs on clouds,
baskets of flowers, and green wreaths, round the rim whose
extreme edge was of dark blue hatched with gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That must be the poor woman’s monogram in the
middle, then,” said one of them, and Valentine knew
that she was looking at the gold T in the centre, intertwined
with a V of roses and forget-me-nots, and surmounted
by a coronet. “T for Trélan, of course—I
wonder what the V stood for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Camain. “Victoire or Victorine,
I expect. Do you know, Mademoiselle Dufour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why on earth should I?” asked Rose Dufour indifferently.
“Let me look at it, Georges—I’ll take it
in my own hands, thanks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Great God, how clumsy
you are!” For the sound of a smash told that the late
Duchesse de Trélan’s plate now existed only in fragments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the ensuing recriminations between the Deputy
and his <span class='it'>innamorata</span>, and the expressions of concern from
everybody else in the room, including her own three prospective
picture-gazers, Valentine’s ears were strained to
catch other sounds. And as she still did not hear them
she began to entertain a faint hope. The château was so
large that a man might lead his pursuers a good dance
and elude them in the end. Unfortunately M. de Brencourt
was not familiar with its topography.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you say you dropped it because you were carrying
my pelisse I’ll take the pelisse myself!” Mlle Dufour’s
voice emerged again, sounding less good-humoured than
usual. “No, I’m not going to carry it on my arm—Heaven
forbid. You can put it on my shoulders, only
don’t drop it also—Bon Dieu, what’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a loud knock had come at the door, which stood
ajar—a knock that sounded to Valentine like the summons
of Fate. Moving a trifle, she was able to see the soldier
outside, whose approaching footfalls the recent scene
had drowned. A sensitive lady gave a little scream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s there?” asked Camain, the violet satin held
above Mlle Dufour’s bare shoulders. “Excuse me, ma
mie!” He dropped the cloak upon its destination without
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
much ceremony, and strode to the door, where the National
Guard was seen to salute and to say something in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut, tut!” said the Deputy. “Well, I suppose
I had better come down and ask him a few questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Georges?” asked the Dufour, who had
glided to the door after him, the ermine slipping half off
her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The guard have captured a man who has just made an
entrance into the building, and they would like me to have
a look at him before marching him off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How interesting!” cried the actress. “What a
coup de théâtre! Do not go down to him, Georges!
Let them bring him up here! This might have been
arranged for us. What was he doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody could answer that question but Valentine, and
she only in part. Camain hesitated a moment, but only
a moment. “Very well,” he said. “Tell them to bring
him up here,” he added to the National Guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hot flame of indignation ran over the Duchesse. The
Comte de Brencourt, a gentleman, was then to be made a
show for the passing curiosity of a courtesan and her
friends! But what had he been about, in daylight too?
The same question no doubt was exercising the Deputy,
for he turned round, his look seeking her out; and, being
half a head taller than any one else in the room, he easily
found her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a pretty find to be made on your domain,
Madame Vidal!” he said. The voice sounded jocular, but she
was not sure of the genuineness of that jocularity. She was
saved the necessity of a reply by a remark from one of the
ladies, winged by a malicious side-glance at her, the shabby,
middle-aged caretaker; “Perhaps it is the Prince come
after the Sleeping Beauty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half ashamed, the men sniggered too. Valentine’s
anger, lit in spite of her contempt, served usefully to
steady her. “It is more likely, Monsieur le Député,”
she said coldly, “that he has come after something in this
room—there are valuables here, are there not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the moment, most certainly!” cut in one of the
youngish men, bowing with a fatuous air in the direction
of Rose and the others.
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“But in the daytime!” said Camain musingly. His
eyes strayed to the jasper cup. “I’ll have the room made
surer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I shall beg leave to give up the key,” said Valentine,
her head high. Anything to foster the idea of ordinary
theft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not ask you——” Camain was beginning, when
the tramp of feet in the corridor interrupted him. “Ah,
here is our adventurer. Yes, bring him in, men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Comte de Brencourt felt the indignity of his
position, he did not show it. His chief preoccupation,
Valentine could not but feel, was to avoid looking at her.
He had not been secured without a struggle, that was
evident, for there was a cut on his forehead, and his neckcloth
was wrenched half off. His arms were bound to his
sides by a pipe-clayed cross-belt. Valentine could not
keep her eyes off him, but the Comte himself looked nowhere
but at Camain. And Camain, advancing a little,
studied him for a moment, his hands behind his back, his
rather prominent blue eyes suddenly grown searching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your report, corporal?” he said abruptly, still running
his gaze over the captive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The National Guard related a story to which no one in
the room listened more fixedly than the concierge of Mirabel:
how the sentry—apparently neither Grégoire nor Jacques—happening
to look round at the château not very long
after the entry of the Deputy and his party, had seen a
man getting in at one of the ground-floor windows, how
he had summoned the guard and they, selecting the same
window, as the quickest mode of entrance, had at last run
the intruder to earth on the basement floor and, after a
lively resistance, captured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very smart work, corporal,” said the Deputy. “But
that window—what window was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We found ourselves when we got in, Citizen Deputy,
in that room they call the ‘sallette.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sallette!” echoed Camain in surprise, and Valentine
suppressed an exclamation. How nearly right her
presentiments had been, then! But to enter by the window,
in broad daylight, in view of the sentry; it sounded crazy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what had he in his pockets?” went on the
Deputy.
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“These small tools, Citizen Deputy, a handkerchief,
and a case with assignats; we have not counted them yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(He must have had time to get rid of the plan, then.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my fine fellow, and what have you to say for
yourself?” The words were careless, but the tone was
so different from anything which Mme de Trélan had yet
heard him use, that, for the first time, she realised how
Georges Camain might have been a Terrorist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this the prisoner was understood to mutter, in a
strong patois, that he hoped the citizen would not be too
severe on a poor man, that the times were bitter hard—no
work, no food—and he had thought he might light on
something or other in Mirabel that nobody would miss .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His dishevelled appearance, the blood trickling down one
cheek, and a certain amount of dirt that M. de Brencourt
had somehow accumulated, went really a good way to
obliterate the marks of race. Perhaps he would succeed
in carrying it off that he was a common thief. The Deputy
seemed inclined to believe it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rather think, my man,” he said, with a smile which
had in it nothing of amiable, “that you have known the
inside of a gaol already, from the look of you. However,
we shall hear all about that later. You had better take
him to the guard-house for the present,” he remarked to
the corporal, “and make arrangements for having him
conveyed to Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the end of this little speech Valentine had realised
where the captive’s eyes, which had already removed themselves
from his inquisitor’s, were now fixed—on the portrait
of her husband as a young man which faced him all the
while.
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c12'>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE ROOK’S MOVE: CHECK TO THE ROOK</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>If, owing to the slackness of the once fire-eating Grégoire
and his superior, Roland’s apparition in the gardens of
Mirabel had produced but little stir in official quarters, it
was not so with the actual capture of a delinquent made
within the château, and practically under the eyes of the
Deputy himself. For two days Mirabel was turned inside
out, and Camain, the outwardly easy-going, piqued by this
daring intrusion, superintended much of the search in
person. What the soldiers and police agents expected to
find appeared doubtful; and indeed there was actually
little for them to discover, since, already aware of the
strangely open method of ingress selected by the invader,
they paid no attention to the broken shutter at the back
of Mirabel which had originally admitted him. The one
genuine discovery which they made intrigued them a good
deal—the lantern lying in the colonnade not far from the
windows of the sallette—for why should a man want
a lantern in the daytime?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It puzzled Valentine also when she came to hear of it;
but, after thought, she came to the conclusion that the
lantern was, for her at least, the key to the whole mystery
of the Comte’s arrest—as indeed it was. She recalled
that he had had a lantern when she found him in the
sallette that evening; on searching her memory was fairly
sure that he had not brought it with him to her room, and
supposed that next morning, suddenly remembering having
left it where its presence, if discovered, might prove very
awkward for him—or for her—he had gone, at a most
unfortunate moment, to retrieve it, had nearly been trapped
in the sallette by the advent of Camain and his party, and
in desperation had climbed with it through the window,
trusting to the colonnading outside to hide him. But on
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
returning, after an interval, by the same way, he had had
the ill-luck to be seen. For all she knew, that had been
the road by which he had originally entered Mirabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until a day or two had elapsed that Valentine
realised how fortunate for her was the fact that M. de Brencourt
had been found breaking in, apparently for the first
time, during the presence of visitors. It occurred to no one
that it was not his first invasion, and had there been complicity
on the part of the concierge it was plain that he
would never have chosen such a time. That M. Camain
himself entertained no suspicions of her was proved by the
frankness with which, coming daily during this period of
turmoil, he kept his subordinate posted up in the course
of events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The authorities can make nothing of the man,” he
admitted in her little room, on the third morning. “They
cannot even discover his name. But, chiefly because he
turned out to have too large a sum of money on him for
a common malefactor, he has been clapped into the Temple,
on the chance of his being a political offender.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Political!” ejaculated Valentine. “What political
object could be served by breaking in here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I confess I cannot imagine,” responded the administrator.
“But the Royalists are up to all sorts of games.
If he had been better-looking, now, one might have put
forward a theory that he was the Duc de Trélan himself,
come back to have a peep at the place .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as you once
suggested to me that he might, Madame Vidal!” He
laughed, as at something equally preposterous and amusing,
but all the colour went from Valentine’s face. That
surmise, made in utter and desperate jest as it had been,
could never know fulfilment now!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” went on the Deputy, unobservant, “I am relieved
to find that there is no question of the Minister of Police
wanting to confront you with this man, as I was afraid,
at one point, that there might be. It is possible, however,
that he may require some sworn statement of conditions
here, a deposition, in short, such as one makes before a
notary. And I also should be glad of it for the sake of my
reputation, for though this man was fortunately seen and
captured at once, you will imagine, Madame, that I am
not pleased to learn about that other marauder who escaped
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
from the garden a while ago, though that has been kept
very quiet—too quiet, in fact. Will you believe, Madame
Vidal, that I was only a few days ago informed of that
episode?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine stared at him, disconcerted. “But I thought
you knew of that, Monsieur le Député!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally. I ought to have known of it. Well, there
is a more zealous sergeant at the poste de garde now, and
there will henceforth be a sentry on duty here all night.
So I hope that your peace will not be molested again.
Now, Madame, if you will kindly give me writing materials.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thank you. Be seated, pray. I shall ask you to
give me an account of the early part of that day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is nothing to give an account of,” said the
Duchesse. If he had asked for the preceding evening!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better,” returned Camain, trying the nib
of the quill on his finger-nail. “Still, you can tell me
how the day was passed, from your rising in the morning;
and what, if anything, you observed of unusual. I take
it, of course, that you had not seen this man lurking about
the place before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not,” lied Valentine gallantly. After
all, it was not for herself. But she was glad she had not
to meet his eye, as he glanced up for a second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sure of that,” said he, beginning to write. “Now,
although I am not a notary, we will observe the forms.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
‘Je soussignée.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ What is your baptismal name,
Madame Vidal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hastily Mme de Trélan put forward the least aristocratic
sounding of her names. “Marie,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Marie,’ ” repeated the scribe, in somewhat lingering
tones. “ ‘Marie.’ ‘I, the undersigned, Marie Vidal.’
Widow, of course?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Valentine rather faintly, for the question
stabbed her. The Deputy looked up, and she had an
impression that he was going to ask her how long she had
been a widow, and that she would be mesmerised into
answering that she did not know, that it was just what she
was seeking to know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But he did not; he settled
to business instead—and was very business-like too.
Valentine had to account for every hour of that morning,
and as she really had no right in the Duc’s apartments she
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
did not find it too easy. When it was finished, and she
had signed, he thanked her, and looking at his watch left
somewhat precipitately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine came back rather thoughtful from accompanying
him to the door, which she always conceived it her duty
to do. He was kind; she did not like deceiving him—though
indeed she had no hand in this enterprise of the
Comte de Brencourt’s any more than in Roland de Céligny’s.
All she was doing was to hold her tongue about the Comte’s
identity, and to wish him well out of the Temple. His
sudden capture, however, had profoundly affected her
own affairs, for he could not now be the bearer of her
intended letter to the Marquis de Kersaint, nor—since
he had left her that night without giving her his leader’s
address—could she send it by any other means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unless, indeed, she thought, standing by the high barred
window and looking out, she were to discover M. de Kersaint’s
whereabouts by communication with Roland de
Céligny, if he were still with his cousins. No, to approach
Roland might be very inauspicious for him just at this
juncture; moreover, she must hope, for his own sake,
that he had left Paris by now. She must wait a little;
and, after all, the initial shock was over. Gaston was
dead, and details of the how and when of his death
could not help him to life again. She hoped he had not
died in poverty. She could not bear that thought.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor could she bear, just now, the consciousness that
M. Georges Camain was beginning to look upon her with
an eye more beaming than that of an employer. Even
his consideration, for which she had been grateful, was
coming to displease her, for surely it exceeded what was
due to a concierge. Not being born to that estate she
could not feel certain about this, but she did know that
a demeanour in the Deputy which even as Mme
Vidal she disliked, as the Duc de Trélan’s widow she
abhorred.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>And she was troubled next day, when M. Camain appeared
again, in a shirt of fine batiste fastened with a golden
butterfly, bearing a bunch of roses in his hand. He laid
them down on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am happy to tell you, Madame Vidal, that the deposition
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
was quite sufficient. You will not be molested in
any way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Citizen Deputy, I am most grateful to you,”
said the Duchesse—and meant it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are more than welcome,” returned her benefactor
with a bow. “It is a pleasure to serve you in anything.
Besides, I look upon you as a colleague in the preservation
of Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was well said, if, again, an unusual sentiment.
However, the look which followed its enunciation gave
Valentine a sudden presentiment that his next words were
going to be less well chosen, and she became acutely
conscious of the red roses on the table. But at that very
moment the door burst abruptly open, and Louise, with a
bucket of water and a mop tied up in a cloth, clanged into
the little room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I beg your pardon, Madame Vidal, I thought you
were upstairs, and I was going to wash the.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh,
Monsieur le Député!” She was struck speechless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go,” said Georges Camain at once. “No, remain,
my good woman, and do your work.” Her he did not
address as colleague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray, Monsieur le Député——” began the Duchesse,
for form’s sake, though in reality she could have embraced
that bucket-bearing form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” said he quite good-humouredly. “I would
not for the world interfere with your wise dispositions. Do
not come to the door, I beg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He disappeared, only just avoiding a second bucket which
Louise had left outside in the passage, and Valentine
turned away to hide a smile, but not because of the bucket,
for that anyone should fall over such an object was not
a form of humorous incident that appealed to her. Her
mirth, however, was of a very fleeting nature, since the
situation had elements which did not amuse her at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look what beautiful flowers M. le Député has brought,
Madame!” said Louise, suddenly seeing them. “He
doubtless brought them for you. A very affable gentleman,
M. Camain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme de Trélan glanced at the roses, still lying on the
table. Impossible to tell, since the bearer had been so
hastily routed, whether they were intended for her or no.
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
On the whole she feared they were. Then the idea of
another destination occurred to her. The affable gentleman
was probably on his way to Mlle Dufour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can take them away with you when you go,
Louise,” she said, indifferently. “M. le Député must
have forgotten them. But it is a pity that they should
be wasted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely Madame will keep them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dislike the scent of roses,” was Madame’s quite
curt reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Rose—<span class='it'>the</span> Rose—she had made up her mind about
that ornament of the theatre. There could never have
been anything between her and Gaston, fastidious as
he had been to his finger-tips. Mlle Dufour had not enough
mind even to have amused him. But there was such a
thing as claiming for lover a man who had on one occasion,
or perhaps two, paid a woman some slight, half careless
attention, especially when that man’s admiration was
in itself a distinction. The Duchesse de Trélan had
known it done in far higher circles than those in which
Mlle Dufour moved. Something told her that in 1790
the actress had employed that useful method of self-advertisement,
and who was there then—or ever—to gainsay
its truth? To-day that man’s wife, having seen the
claimant, felt with every instinct that the claim was false.
But she did not detest Rose much the less.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Camain did not come again for several days. The little
sprite which dwelt in Mme de Trélan’s brain, even in the
cloud of sorrow and remorse, suggested that he was trying
to find out and avoid a day when minor “colleagues”
might come charging into her room. And luck served
him, for he arrived one beautiful afternoon when she was
quite alone. But he seemed in a very business-like mood,
and while he apologised for interrupting her sewing, he
told her the reason for his visit; he was thinking of having
the garden put in better order, though, as he said, the
ridiculous sum which the Directory placed at his disposal
would not admit of much being done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I know very little about gardens,” he concluded.
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
“Now, a woman’s taste .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Will you come out with me
and give me the benefit of your advice, Madame
Vidal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Monsieur le Député,” objected Valentine, “I
am not a Lenôtre. It is gardening on a grand scale here—landscape
gardening. I suppose, however, that you
could begin by putting the Italian garden in the front
a little in order. Shall I come out there with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Camain shook his head. “I should prefer to do
something to the wilderness at the back—for a wilderness
it is fast becoming. You would be doing Mirabel a real
service if you would come out there with me now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine had to acknowledge to herself that, assuming
his sudden anxiety about the garden to be genuine, this
was certainly true. And the state of the park had long
afflicted her. Nevertheless she went unwillingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Deputy’s business-like mood continued, and
from the great terrace at the top the two took a general
survey of the rioting vegetation. Nodding spires of
foxgloves pierced it now, and the stately candles of the
mulleins were lit, while round the rose-trees, turned
once more to briars, the bindweed stretched her strangling
arms, and trumpeted her victories from a thousand mouths.
And arbour after arbour was nothing but a mantle of the
white stars of the wild clematis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into this jungle the administrator and the concierge
of Mirabel descended after a little, and pushed their way
along the paths, discussing the pruning and lopping of
laurel and arbor vitæ, and the possibility of re-shaping
the yews that once had been ships or peacocks. But it
seemed very hopeless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I can hardly wonder that that marauder
escaped the other day,” commented M. Camain, standing
at the top of a flight of steps not very far from the scene
of the invader’s mishap. “It would need an army to
make any impression on this. I almost think that you are
right, Madame Vidal, and that, with the meagre means at
my disposal; I shall have at present to content myself with
the front garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is only one saving clause,” he remarked suddenly
over his shoulder as he led the way back, “and that is,
that to put order into this tangle would destroy its character
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
of the Sleeping Beauty’s enchanted forest, on which
Mme Constant remarked so aptly the other day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine, annoyed, bit her lip and, answering nothing,
followed him at a slackening pace. But M. Georges
Camain, having arrived at a seat in the bosquet through
which they were passing, turned round and waited for
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we sit down a moment after our walk?” he
suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a curved stone seat which the honeysuckle had
so invaded as to leave little room. But one end was still
clear. On this the Duchesse unwillingly sat down, and
her employer did the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It only occurred to me the other day,” he began in a
conversational tone, looking at her profile, “that I might
in some sort claim relationship with you, Madame
Vidal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, Citizen Deputy! How is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as I have the happiness to call Mme Tessier
cousin, it appears to me that, since you are akin to her,
I might have the even greater happiness of thinking of
you as——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As your aunt, were you going to say, Citizen?”
interrupted Mme de Trélan with, a gleam. “But I am
afraid that I cannot aspire to that honour. It is only by
marriage that I am related to Suzon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear you are mocking me, Madame,” said Camain
in a tone of relish. “You must be well aware that I do
not conceive of you as my aunt.” His hand was creeping
towards her along the back of the seat, over the tangled
honeysuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am nearly forty-five years old, Monsieur le Député,”
said Valentine in a very repressive voice. “Old enough
to be a grandmother.” She rose. “Now, if you will
excuse me, I must be getting back to my work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that is just what I do not wish you to do, Madame
Vidal,” interposed Camain, getting to his feet with even
greater alacrity. “Oblige me by sitting down a moment,
and by listening to what I have to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As his not inconsiderable bulk blocked the only egress
from the seat there was nothing for it but to comply, and
this, after a momentary hesitation, Mme de Trélan did.
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must by this time,” began Camain, clearing his
throat, “have become aware, Madame, of my profound
admiration for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that you have shown me great consideration,
Citizen,” responded Valentine, “and I assure you that
it has been appreciated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be impossible for me to do too much to show
my regard for you,” said the Deputy earnestly. “Your
talents, Madame, your character, your gifts of heart and
brain—you must forgive me if I point out (what you must
surely know) that they are thrown away upon your present
situation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that a kind way of intimating, Monsieur le Député,
that you wish me to resign it?” enquired Valentine,
immensely relieved at the goal towards which, after all,
the conversation appeared to be making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have hit the nail on the head,” replied M. Camain
with a peculiar smile. “I do wish you to resign this post,
so unworthy of your sensibilities and your education. I
wish to remove you, with your consent, to another, which
I dare to flatter myself will be less unworthy of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme de Trélan looked at him mutely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All this, Madame,” pursued the Deputy, waving his
hand to include not only the garden but the château itself,
“all this, over which you exercise so wise a regency, is but
a dead kingdom. You are but the guardian of a cenotaph.
But imagine yourself,” he went on, warming to his trope,
“imagine yourself ruling with a real authority where all is,
on the contrary, alive, where every subject is your—I
should say, every wish is your subject, every project laid
at your feet for approval, every——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Valentine broke in rather ruthlessly by saying, “I
cannot imagine to what kingdom you refer, Monsieur
Camain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not divine?” said he, and the smile became
more marked. “You must guess—’tis your adorable
woman’s modesty which dictates that reluctance! Madame
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>Marie</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the kingdom which I invite you to enter—ah
no, not to enter, for you are already enthroned there,
but to sway absolutely—is at your feet this moment, is, in
short, this heart!” finished M. Camain, transferring himself
very neatly from the bench beside her to one bended
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
knee, and clasping both hands to the neighbourhood of
the organ he had named.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine surveyed him there on the gravel with stupefaction
and a spice of malicious amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I to understand, Monsieur le Député, that you
are good enough to offer me the post recently occupied by
Mlle Dufour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her suitor reddened. “Good God, no, Madame! I
must have expressed myself but ill if I gave you to suppose
that! No, Mlle Dufour and I have parted. It is my
hand, in all respect and honesty, of which I have the
honour to ask your acceptance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In short,” said the Duchesse, unable to resist, “vous
allez vous ranger. Please get up, Citizen. I am very
much honoured by your offer, but it is impossible for me
to accept it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her wooer kept his countenance very well. Possibly
he had expected this refusal, as a further manifestation of
the modesty to which he had alluded. He did get up,
and, dusting the traces of the greenish gravel off the knees
of his small-clothes, stood before her, rather a fine figure of
a man, who probably carried off better than most the
ridiculous red toga <span class='it'>à l’antique</span> which the members of the
Conseil des Anciens had to wear at their assemblies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am too sudden, perhaps, Madame?” he enquired,
his head on one side. “I recognise and bow to your
superior delicacy. A flower should never be plucked in a
hurry. And yet, the encouragement I have received——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Encouragement, Monsieur?” exclaimed the Duchesse.
“Whence did you derive that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Deputy made her a bow. “You have been—unintentionally,
no doubt—kinder than you knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to say that I—<span class='it'>I</span>—gave you encouragement,
Monsieur?” All the Duchesse de Trélan was in
the astonishment of that emphasized pronoun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not openly, Madame, I admit—but in a way you
were unconscious of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most certainly I was unconscious of it!” said Valentine,
in a tone of the strongest indignation. “Your
imagination, Monsieur le Député, runs away with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, I only used my eyes,” pleaded Camain, undeterred
by her displeasure—seeming, indeed, rather to
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
enjoy it. And he sat down again on the seat. “You
would not, naturally, be aware of it, chère Madame.
But cast your mind back a week—to the day of the arrest.
It was on that day that I first received hope.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I see
you do not believe me. Must I convince you then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cannot, Monsieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Camain bent nearer. “Do you challenge me? Ah,
Madame Marie, but you will be angry with me! It was,
then—you remember that day, Mlle Dufour was with me—it
was the way you looked .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in which I saw you
looking .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the hostile way, in short, in which you looked
at poor Rose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Rose</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the way I looked .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you think—is it
possible that you imagine, Monsieur Camain, that I was
jealous of your mistress?” A white and royal anger
possessed the Duchesse, and she got up from the stone
bench more like a queen than a concierge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you would be angry,” said Camain plaintively,
gazing up at her. “But as I live, I saw you looking at
her once or twice in a manner which seemed to me to admit
of only one explanation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme de Trélan gasped. She had no words before a
supposition so monstrous. What had begun by resembling
farce had turned to something else. Here, in her own
garden, to be subjected to the insolent fatuity of this
man of no breeding! And Rose Dufour, of all women.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is impossible for me to remain at Mirabel to be
insulted, Monsieur Camain,” she said very haughtily.
“Will you kindly relieve me of my charge here, and
replace me as soon as you can? I should prefer to leave
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Camain stooped and picked up his cameo-headed
cane. With this, rising, he poked the ground for a few
seconds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am obliged by the terms of my appointment, Madame
Vidal,” he said at the end of them, “to receive notice of
resignation in writing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you shall have it in writing at once,” returned
she. “If you will kindly let me pass——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood aside. “Send it by post, Madame, to-morrow,
if you are still of the same mind. Though why my most
respectful admiration should be construed——”
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is enough, Monsieur,” said Mme de Trélan as she
might have spoken to a disobedient servant, and walked
straight past him out of the grove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Camain, deputy for Maine-et-Loire, did not follow
her. After a moment he reseated himself on the stone
bench, and, crossing one blue and white striped leg over
the other, rubbed his ankle thoughtfully. Then a sort of
smile passed over his well-shaven face, he put a finger
and thumb into a waistcoat pocket, and drew forth a little
almanac, which he consulted. This done, he rose and
sauntered towards the lower end of the park, to a certain
little door in the outer wall which, to his knowledge, had
not been used for years. It had, as he knew, bolts only
on the inside, so the absence of a key need not deter him
from leaving Mirabel by that way .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless indeed long
disuse should have rusted those bolts in their sockets, or
the ivy have bolted it in another fashion.
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c13'>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE BISHOP’S MOVE</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>It was not until Valentine’s letter of resignation had gone
that she realised what, in the heat of her anger, she had
done. She had shut herself out of Mirabel for ever. To-morrow
would probably be the last day she should ever
spend there. Was it really only a week ago that, fresh
from the shock of the Comte’s news, she had wondered
how she could possibly have put herself into such a position?
Well, she had still more indignant reason for wonder
at herself to-day, yet—she had suddenly discovered that
she did not want to quit Mirabel. But it was too late now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next afternoon a messenger brought her a letter addressed
in Camain’s large, sprawling hand. Out of it fell a spray
of young ivy. Mme de Trélan looked at it distastefully—some
sentimental afterthought, no doubt, of her bourgeois
wooer’s—and letting it lie on the table read his
regrets at her decision to resign, his surprise at the resentment
aroused by his “deeply respectful addresses”—and
his reminder that by the terms of her appointment
she had agreed to give thirty days’ notice of resignation,
and that she was not therefore legally free to leave Mirabel
till the 27th of Thermidor next. But the rejected suitor
pledged his word that, unless obliged, he would not enter
the château again during her stay, so that she might feel
at liberty from the menace of a devotion which was evidently
distasteful. “And perhaps,” the letter concluded,
“in that period the rest of this torn ivy, which you will
no doubt recognise, may have time to grow again over the
little door near the Allée des Soupirs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter dropped from Valentine’s hand. Was it a
threat—this about the door? Could he know anything
about Roland, from some unsuspected source, or did he
perceive no more than that the door had recently been
used? But, as Roland must surely have quitted Paris
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
by now, the sprig of ivy moved her not, and the most
potent emotion roused by her employer’s letter was probably
the last he intended—relief. Through that forgotten
thirty days’ warning she had a respite; she need not
leave Mirabel yet. She had never dreamed that she could
be so deeply thankful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For she would have fuller leisure now to think of Gaston,
whose widow she was—whose widow she had been, perhaps,
for long enough already, even though this Chouan
leader had only recently learnt the fact of his death.
Yes, she had known that all along. That was why Gaston
had never answered her letters, never sought for her. It
was not indifference, but a gaoler far more implacable who
had held him captive; and the reflection that he had
possibly been dead for years held a terrible kind of comfort
in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was Gaston de Trélan’s widow, in Gaston’s violated
home. And it seemed to her that these twenty-nine days
had been given her to go over their life together, and to
pray for him. Afterwards, when she, too, had left that
home for ever, she would take steps to communicate with
the Marquis de Kersaint in the hopes of hearing more.
So, before the empty tabernacle in the cold, half-pillaged
chapel, where in the presence of such a brilliant company
the Archbishop of Paris had made them one, she prayed
for him every night and morning, at hours when no one
was likely to summon her. Suzon was indisposed and
could not come to see her. Camain had sworn not to come.
And more than half the allotted respite slid by—too
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme de Trélan had not mentioned her approaching
departure to Louise and the rest of her minions. A faint hope
began to stir in her, as time went on, that the Deputy would
ask her to reconsider her decision. Her anger against him
had measurably died down; it seemed to her now rather
absurd that she had been so hot. The man knew no better;
and, had not Rose been involved in his amazing “proof”
she might even have seen the ludicrous side of it. But
despite her conviction about her, nothing connected with
Mlle Dufour could be to her amusing—only hateful. Yet,
if M. Camain did ask her to stay on as concierge, how was
she to regulate their intercourse in future?
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>So July went on, with reverses abroad and discontent
at home, and Valentine saw now the use to which she would
put the money, the price of Roland’s safety, for when she
was free she would find some priest who would say Masses
for Gaston’s soul, and she would herself go to her duties,
as she had done now, regularly but surreptitiously, for
years. For she felt on her own soul a deadly sin of pride;
and if Gaston had contracted a sacrilegious marriage before
he died, the fault was partly hers. What were those
few letters which she had sent compared to the more active
steps which she ought to have taken to find him—steps
which, now that it was too late, she could not conceive
why she had not taken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she longed so intensely for the comfort of the
Mass that she thought she would have asked Suzon, had
she not been indisposed, to take her place at Mirabel for a
night, to allow her to attend in Paris one of the churches
where, in a half clandestine fashion, it was celebrated.
Then she would remember that in a couple of weeks she
would be free to do this, since—Camain having given no
further sign—Mirabel would shortly know her no more.
Her desire changed its goal a little then, and became a
longing that the chapel of Mirabel itself which had
witnessed their union might know once more the offering
of the holy mysteries, for Gaston’s soul and for her grave
shortcomings too. Alas, there appeared small chance of
that.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“I see you have got a gardener, Madame Vidal,” observed
Louise one morning as she came in. “He seems
very busy out in the front there. An oldish man for all
that work, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was right. Later on, when Valentine looked out,
she did indeed descry an elderly man busy with what
had been the flower beds in the Italian garden. Then she
remembered that Camain, on that memorable day, had
spoken of his intention of having the beds attended to.
Still, one man could not accomplish very much in so absolute
a desolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gardener did not come near the château, nor did
she take any notice of him till two days later. It happened
to turn extremely cold for the beginning of August, and at
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
midday, as she saw this industrious elderly person sitting
eating on a barrow, she thought he might like to conclude
his meal under the shelter of the colonnades, with the
addition, perhaps, of a cup of coffee. She went up the
steps, crossed to the bed by which he was sitting, and
suggested it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without his hat, which the gardener removed as he rose
on her approach, his face was seen to be round and comfortable.
He seemed about fifty, hale and vigorous, with
a twinkling eye. He thanked Mme de Trélan warmly,
very warmly, for her kind thought, left his barrow, and
betook himself up the great steps to the shelter of the
colonnade, while she returned to her own quarters to make
him some coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time she brought it out to him he had finished
his meal, and was standing in front of the boarded-up door
looking at it. He turned round, took the cup from her
with a little bow, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, you do more in offering me this cup of coffee
than you know. I am thirsty, it is true, but I am even
more thirsty for talk with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchesse stared at him. He spoke with a slight
accent, but his speech was educated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have dug,” went on the gardener, sipping the coffee,
“for three days in the garden, and I desire presently, with
your permission, to dig in the château itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, are you another of them?” cried Valentine
involuntarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. “Even so, Madame. And since the arrest
of M. de Brencourt has——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know M. de Brencourt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are under the same orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those of this Marquis de Kersaint?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely,” said the gardener, and he now gulped
down the coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” objected the Duchesse, puzzled, “how is it
that you confide in me so readily? With M. de Brencourt”—“it
was different,” she was going on to say, but
stopped, realising that she was on the verge of an indiscretion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because in the first place,” said the new treasure-seeker,
“I went, on the receipt of certain information, to
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
those old MM. de Céligny to whom you so cleverly restored
their interesting young relative; and from them—since
the boy has returned to his grandfather—I learnt all that
Roland had told them of your devotion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roland has gone, then?” said she, relieved. “He
was well again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very nearly. The wound was not serious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the second gentleman—he who was arrested,
M. de Brencourt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is still imprisoned in the Temple, but soon to leave
it, I hope. He has found a venial guard, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one
has agents in Paris, you know, Madame. It is from them
that I have learnt the facts about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope that you may not follow him to the Temple,
Monsieur,” said Valentine, rather troubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so too,” said the newcomer composedly. “But
since I hold a certain position here, having—no matter
how—procured the post of an accredited gardener, I
shall set about matters quietly. I propose, therefore, to
go on attending to my horticultural duties for a space
before beginning my investigation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme de Trélan studied the little man a moment. He
seemed an extremely unhurried plotter—either a very
cool hand, or one who was inclined to take things too
easily. It was impossible for her to judge. It suddenly
came to her, however, that the means of communication
with M. de Kersaint were restored. When she knew
rather more about him she could ask this emissary to bear
her letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want me to help you, Monsieur, I suppose?”
she suggested. “But what if I have scruples—I am not
sure that I have not? I did not help either of the others,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall respect your scruples, Madame. Unless you
carry them so far as to denounce me, I can do what is
necessary without claiming your active assistance. All
I shall ask is that you remark on it to no one if I transfer
the scene of my labours, in a day or two, from the front
garden to the park behind. And now, if you will excuse
me,” he concluded, “I will return to my wheelbarrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before you go, Monsieur, may I know your name?”
asked Valentine. Then she caught herself up. “No,
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
I think I know too many names. I would rather not hear
it. It is better for your sake that I should know you only
as the gardener of Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now this abstention of the concierge’s suited M. Chassin
admirably. Although he had never been at Mirabel (just
as he had never seen its Duchess) it was as well that his
name, undistinguished though it were, should not be
whispered there. So he bowed a little and said, “As you
please, Madame. But possibly you know it already from
one of the other gentlemen—from M. de Céligny, perhaps,
if he talked to you much about M. de Kersaint, whose
aumônier I have the honour to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a priest, then?” exclaimed Mme de Trélan,
surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Presbyter valde indignus</span>,” replied M. Chassin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had not guessed it,” said Valentine. “Though
indeed why should I?—Yes, M. de Céligny did refer to
the aumônier, now I come to think of it, in connection
with the plan of the treasure, but he did not mention
the name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I will remain the aumônier, or the gardener,
according as you please, Madame,” said M. Chassin briskly.
“What shall I do with this cup—besides thanking you a
thousand times for its contents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchesse took it from him. “If you care for
another to-morrow at the same hour, Monsieur l’Aumônier,
it will be at your disposal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too good, Madame,” replied the priest.
“You are sure my presence—our conversation—will not
bore you?” There was a little twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the contrary,” responded Mme de Trélan. “I
find all this passionately interesting. I feel that I am
assisting at a romance. Is it not in the old fairy-tales
that three sons of a king come after a treasure, or to slay a
dragon, or free a princess?—and it is always the third and
last who succeeds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, Madame,” said the third and last adventurer,
“I am no king’s son. That description may serve for
MM. de Céligny and de Brencourt, but my father was a
shoemaker. I should not be worthy to free a princess.
Besides, as I have told you, I am a priest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moreover there are no princesses here,” added Valentine
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
hastily, annoyed with herself for having chosen just
that illustration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor a dragon?” enquired the treasure-seeker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, unless it be the Deputy or the sentry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The latter, indeed, may be wondering at our conversation
now, if he can see us in here,” observed the gardener,
and he began to move towards the steps. “By the way,
Madame, is it true that the Deputy Camain does not come
here much now? I heard from .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a source of information
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that his visits, at one time very frequent, have
practically ceased of late. Is that so? It is somewhat
important for me to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that is quite correct,” answered the Duchesse,
and was again annoyed with herself because she felt the
colour rising to her face.
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c14'>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>PLOTTER AND PRIEST</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Not until that evening did Roland’s exact words about
the aumônier recur to Mme de Trélan’s memory. Who
could she have been, the dying old lady who possessed
this mysterious document? It was all but clear now
that some treasure really did exist in Mirabel; but its
existence, as a matter of fact, interested Mirabel’s mistress
less than the means by which it had come to light after all
these years. She had no intention of claiming the hoard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And more amazing than all was the fact that this third
treasure-seeker was a priest. It seemed almost as if her
fervent wish of the last days were on its way to be granted.
Could she ask him to say Mass in Mirabel—would it be
safe? She knew nothing about him personally, but
he could not be a man to shrink from risks, or he would not
be employed on his present mission. He must equally
be an <span class='it'>insermenté</span>, one who had not sworn allegiance to the
State, or he would never be aumônier to a Royalist division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The desire to feel her way towards this great question
of a Mass at Mirabel, as well as to satisfy her curiosity
about the plan, was the reason why next day, at the same
time, as the Abbé-gardener was making with a handkerchief
of provisions towards the colonnades, she went up
the great steps and intercepted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your coffee is awaiting you in my room, Monsieur
l’Aumônier,” she suggested, “if you will give yourself the
trouble to descend thither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thanked her and followed her down, unrolled his
comestibles, took the plate she put before him, and with
little ado set heartily to work. Valentine placed the coffee
pot at his elbow and herself sat down opposite him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you will pardon my rustic manners, Madame,”
he observed after a moment or two, “but this digging
gives a man a fine appetite.”
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust they feed you well where you lodge in the
village, Monsieur l’Abbé,” said she in reply. “Where
do you lodge, by the way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the little house next the church—I beg its pardon,
the Temple of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what is it the Temple of, Madame,
Age, or Genius, or Fame, or what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never enquired,” returned the Duchesse, with
a shade of contempt. “The Temple of Lunacy, I should
think.—Who lives in that little house now? It used to
be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. let me see—Nicole, the locksmith, and his family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nicole the locksmith?” repeated the priest, ceasing
to masticate. “He has not lived there for seven years,
I understand, since Mirabel was sacked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that so?” asked Valentine. “What happened to
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know,” answered the Abbé. “I only know
the bare fact from the old man who lives there now.—Did
you then know Mirabel-le-Château as long ago as
that, Madame Vidal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have known Mirabel a long time,” said Valentine,
after a slight hesitation. If she were going eventually
to ask him to say a Mass here for the Duc de Trélan, she
must give him some sort of ground for making the request.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have lived here before, perhaps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” admitted Mme de Trélan. “How I have come
to live here again, under such different auspices, is the
result of circumstances with which I need not trouble
you. But, since I knew the château before it changed
owners, perhaps you will not think it strange that I should
show curiosity as to how you came into possession of the
plan of which M. de Céligny spoke, and of which I saw a
copy in M. de Brencourt’s possession. M. de Céligny
said something about an old lady who was dying, whom
you visited. But how did she come to have this paper,
and why did she desire to give it to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to M. de Trélan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Chassin wiped his mouth. “It is a long story how
it came into her possession, Madame, but a much shorter
one why she desired it to go to its rightful owner. She
had been tiring-woman to M. de Trélan’s mother, the
Duchesse Eléonore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was her name?” demanded Valentine, a little
breathlessly.
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Magny, Mlle Magny,” said M. Chassin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine got up from the table and went over toward
the stove. The past seemed suddenly to crowd upon her
almost suffocatingly. Behind the other ghosts in Mirabel
she often felt the gentle spirit of the mother-in-law who
had welcomed her with such affection, and now here was
another shadowy inmate. Then she was aware that the
priest was watching her out of his placid, shrewd little eyes
with a good deal of interest, and that she must walk warily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You knew Mlle Magny, I see?” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the Duchesse de Trélan. She remembered
now her first sight of that prim, devoted attendant as it
were yesterday. The best thing for him to suppose would
be that they had been fellow-servants years ago. So she
added, “I was here for the last two years of Mlle Magny’s
service, when, as you say, she was maid to Mme la Duchesse
Douairière.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you here, then, Madame, under the Duchesse
Valentine?” was the priest’s not unnatural question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme de Trélan much disliked lying, although her whole
life recently might have been called a lie. She clung to
the literal truth underlying her statement when she said,
“No, I never served the Duchesse Valentine.” And then,
to turn him away from a dangerous topic, she said, “I
need not ask you, Monsieur l’Abbé, if you are an insermenté
priest. You must be, to hold the position which you do,
and to have received any trust from so good a Catholic
as Mlle Magny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Madame, naturally I have never taken the oath,”
responded M. Chassin. He looked at her with fresh interest,
and added, “You too, then, my daughter, are a good
Catholic in these times of persecution?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was never a Catholic worth speaking of, I am afraid,”
said Valentine rather sadly, “until these times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And are you able to go to your duties here, my child?”
It was remarkable how the cloak of the plotter and half
humorous observer slipped at once aside, and revealed the
priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not here,” responded Mme de Trélan. “I always did
in Paris; it is possible there. But there is no Mass here,
no priest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O mon père!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?”
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lately—for a special reason—I have longed for little
else, night and day, but that there might be Mass said
once in the chapel here, for .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for one who was much
connected with Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her deep earnestness and hardly contained emotion
affected M. Chassin. He was a little puzzled, too. Did
she mean Mlle Magny? If so, why did she not say so?
More likely, perhaps, that she was thinking of some relative
of her own. Perhaps she was the widow of a steward
or something of the kind, for she was far too superior to
have been an ordinary servant. However, practical as
usual, he saw that the point was not for whose soul—if she
meant that—the Mass was to be said, but whether it could
be said at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you the necessaries still in the chapel?” he
asked thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe so,” answered the Duchesse. “I could
look .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know where they would be hidden. A priest
coming like this seems .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She broke off wistfully.
“But there would be a certain amount of risk to you,
Father, and so I hardly like suggesting it. Nothing but
my very real need would make me. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have heard
news that would make it just now the greatest comfort I
could look for in this world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter,” said the Abbé, rising, “as a priest,
nothing could give me greater joy, in these times, than to
hear that you desire such a thing. But, as a plotter, I
think that I must get on a little further with my task
before I undertake the additional risk—not much, perhaps,
but still to be considered when I am charged with a mission
not my own. An argument, no doubt,” he added with a
sort of twinkle, “against the union of the secular and the
sacred characters in one individual. However, I will
think over the best way to fulfil your edifying desire, if
I can. I should begin at once, I think, by starting work
earlier than I have hitherto done, that no suspicion might
be excited on the morning itself, for it would have, would
it not, to be a very early Mass? And you wish, I gather,
a Mass of requiem?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine bowed her head. She was almost too much
stirred to thank him, and looked up with eyes full of
tears.
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Chassin was moved to give her his blessing, and on
that departed once more to his wheelbarrow and his hoe.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine thought of little else but the priest’s half
promise all the rest of the day. Very early next morning
she went and searched in the chapel for the gem-studded
chalice and ciborium, hidden away with all the more
valuable vestments early in 1792, and hidden so securely
that if they had been looked for in the August pillage they
had never been found. That day being a cleaning day
she thought it better not to invite the remarks of her
<span class='it'>femmes de journée</span> by having the gardener into her room
at all. Moreover at first she thought he had not arrived;
till it occurred to her to look out from an upper window
at the back of the château. The result of her observations
was that she took out a bowl of coffee at noon to the grotto
of Latona, and, going in, told him the reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much wiser, Madame,” said the priest, wiping a hot
brow with his sleeve. “And did you say that to-morrow was
a visiting day? Then I shall be back in the front, very
active, for all eyes to see. I have no business to be here
at the back at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you have a good reason for it?” suggested Mme
de Trélan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aumônier dropped his voice. “There is a sort of
underground passage leading from this grotto—which is
of course of later construction—to the place under the
cheminée royale in the sallette where Louis-Antoine de
Trélan hid his money. Once I have unblocked the end
of it, now hidden by those rocks, I hope to find the rest
easy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. de Céligny did not know of that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The misguided youth never got more than a moment’s
sight of the plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And M. de Brencourt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He preferred to attack the other end, in the château,
as likely to prove shorter. The result you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when you have got the money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have to convey it by degrees—or rather, cause it
to be conveyed—to an agent in Paris, and he to England
to be melted down. It is of course useless in its present
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
state. When I reach it I calculate that it will take me
three or four days to get it away, a portion at a time. It
will be too heavy to take all at once, for so much weight
in so little bulk would excite suspicion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see that you are coming earlier,” said Valentine.
“Does that mean that you will be able to say Mass?
I have found all that is requisite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I may promise it,” replied the gardener.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day, as he had predicted, he was working in the
front of the château, and a Deputy whom Valentine showed
round said that he was glad something was being done to
the flower beds, but that he considered M. Camain rather
parsimonious in the matter of labour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the next three days, although the priest had
returned to his work in the park, something invariably
happened to prevent Mme de Trélan from getting speech
with him. But on the fourth afternoon she had the curiosity
to go and stand by the great fireplace in the sallette.
She most distinctly heard gnome-like activities at work
below. Evidently the miner was advancing in his
task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning she sought him out soon after he arrived,
while he was still in the front of the château.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come to my room to-day for your coffee,
Monsieur l’Aumônier?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, Madame,” responded the gardener, and he
walked beside her wheeling his wheelbarrow. “I wanted
to speak with you about a certain arrangement. I shall
not be here much longer, I think,” he added significantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are—advancing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow or the next day will see the end, I hope.
I will certainly come at noon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he came, punctually. He was hot and rather dirty.
Valentine let him eat his meal in peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so it really was true, the tale of the treasure,”
she said meditatively, as he drew to a close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every word, Madame,” replied the priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you have actually secured the whole of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Except the jewels—and unless I am prevented from
going on to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should you be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One never knows,” said he, and finished his coffee with
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
appreciation. “And now,” he added briskly, “about
to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will really do it for me? God reward you,
Father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will come at half-past four to-morrow to your entrance
here. I suppose there is a private door to the chapel from
the château? You will have everything ready? Perhaps
you have made ready for Mass before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have,” said the Duchesse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then that is settled,” observed M. Chassin, brushing
the crumbs off his person. “The sentry is used by now
to my industrious early entrances, and there is no one
about to ask why, having entered, I am not to be seen
working. Nor will anybody, I presume, ring your bell at
that early hour. I see no extra hazard at all; and most of
my treasure trove is already in Paris, in good hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the door he stopped. “There is only one thing more.
For whose soul do you wish this Mass said, Madame Vidal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine did not reply at once. She suddenly saw
what questions it would lead to if she said “For the
Duc de Trélan’s.” Perhaps he would even refuse to
say a requiem for Gaston at all unless she told him
by what right she demanded it. A desire, very unlike
her, to put off the difficult moment seized her. If she
only told him the name to-morrow, at the eleventh hour,
when the candles were lit, and everything ready, surely
he would ask no questions then. Or if it came to it, she
might even tell him who she was. But not now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I tell you to-morrow morning, Father?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Chassin raised his clumsy eyebrows a trifle, but since
he could not very well pretend that it was of paramount
importance to know the name overnight, he said, “Very
well, my daughter,” and departed.
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c15'>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>UNDER THE SEAL</h3>

<p class='noindent'>The chapel at Mirabel, of later date than the château
itself, was one of those lofty, pompous, rococo edifices
abounding in heavy wood-carving, and puffy-cheeked
cherubs, and tribunes with bulged and gilded fronts almost
suggestive of a theatre. But hostile hands, in stripping it
of some of its exuberance, had bestowed the crown of
martyrdom on its floridity, and the light of this early
summer morning, streaming in through the red and purple
clad saints of the apsidal eastern window, seemed a little
to dispel its chill—the chill of a building long disused—though
it could not replace the warm memory of incense
and the winking light before the tabernacle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The candles on the unvested marble altar, and those in
the great carved candlesticks where the bier or catafalque
should have stood, were of brown wax as usage demanded.
Valentine had found them, and in another place the black
and gold vestments for the priest, stored away with the
rest, and she had brought out from the sacristy and spread
between the candlesticks on the floor itself—since there was
no bier—the black pall with the arms of the house of Trélan.
Everything was ready, and now she herself, the solitary
worshipper, knelt with bowed head on a chair in the nave,
though it wanted yet an hour to the priest’s coming.
She was making her preparation for confession, for she
was going to ask for communion at this Mass. The resolve
to do so had come to her during the night.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly half-past four already. Valentine hurried back
to her room. He was very punctual, the gardener priest,
and prudent to boot, for he did not even wake any echoes
by ringing, but tapped upon the outer door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything is ready, mon père. I will take you
straight to the chapel,” said Mme de Trélan.
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Chassin paused a moment when he got inside the
building. This, then, was where his foster-brother had
married the “beautiful and unfortunate lady” as M. de
Brencourt had justly called her. Little as Mme Vidal
had been able to do, the place had something the air of
requiem; he saw the candles, the pall—and then the
arms on the pall. Surely she, a former domestic, would
not have brought that out save for a member of the house!
Then he thought, wondering at his own slow-wittedness,
that of course she wanted a Mass said for the Duchesse
Valentine. He was more than glad to say one here for
the repose of that soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he moved forward again Mme Vidal pointed out the
sacristy. “I will light the candles while you vest, Father,”
she added. “But, before you begin Mass, I should like to
make my confession, for I wish to communicate. And then
I will tell you for whose soul I am asking for this Mass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Chassin, feeling that he hardly needed now to be
told, disappeared into the sacristy. Valentine lit the
candles on the altar and those round the pall. Before she
had finished the priest emerged in alb and stole, tying the
girdle of the former round him as he came, for there was
need of haste in all this business. He entered the confessional,
whose elaborate carving bore scars from axe
or hammer, and drew the curtain after him. She went and
knelt down at the right-hand grille.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>There was absolute silence when Valentine had finished.
All through the priest had hardly said a word or asked
her a question, and from the beginning she had resolved
to make no mysteries, but here, under the seal, to be
perfectly frank about her identity. It would have meant,
perhaps, evasions else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the silence was so prolonged that at last she raised
her eyes, and could just see through the grille enough to
gather that the Abbé had covered his own eyes with his
hand. It was not till then that Valentine fully recognised
how even to this man, unconnected, save as a political
plotter, with the house of Trélan, it must come as a shock
to learn, in the very chapel of Mirabel itself, her identity
with its supposedly murdered mistress. She had not
been thinking enough of herself to realise that; rather of
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
her relations to Gaston. She waited; and after a moment
or two more her confessor seemed to collect himself, and
in a shaken voice named her penance and gave her absolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bent under the weight of freedom Valentine bowed
her head, and so remained—till she suddenly heard the
rungs of the curtain in front of the confessional rattle on
their little pole, and it came to her that the priest, still so
strangely silent, was preparing to leave the box. But
there was still something for her to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, now you can guess for whose soul I wish this
Mass said—for that of my husband, Gaston, Duc de Trélan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still silence. M. Chassin had, in fact, only drawn aside
the curtain because in the tumult of his emotions he felt
that he was suffocating. He was not thinking of moving
at that moment; he was incapable of it. What was he
to do! what, in God’s name, was he to do! And there was
no time to think, that was the terrible part of it. He could
not knowingly enact a sacrilege.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And this, this was
the murdered Duchesse! It was incredible—yet obviously
true, though his brain could hardly grasp it yet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But
the other side of the business! Of course Gaston’s repeated
injunction to respect his secret to the uttermost,
an injunction laid on him afresh not long ago at Hennebont,
did not apply to this case, which the Duc could not
have foreseen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no man could have imagined a resurrection
like this! Yet what was it, “nobody in the world,”
“whatever you think might be gained by it.” He must
have a little time to consider.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And he must say
something now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child,” he managed to get out, “I cannot well say
a requiem Mass unless I have reason to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to know the
person dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I know it, Father,” came the sad voice. “Is
not that enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had heard some rumour, of course. How to convey
to her its falsity without betraying what he knew as fact—and
without undue shock to her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose, my daughter,” he said gently, “that you
have had some private information. Is it—forgive me—is
it reliable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine caught her breath. “Only too much so, I
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
fear.” And then a light broke upon her. “Surely,
Father, as you were sent from the Marquis de Kersaint
about this business, and he knew of the Duc’s death, you
know it, too? Or did he keep you in ignorance before he
sent you to Mirabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” exclaimed M. Chassin, thinking he had not
heard aright through the grille. “What did you say,
my child? M. de Kersaint knew that the Duc was dead?
Who told you that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His astonishment set a mad hope tearing at Valentine’s
heart. “M. de Brencourt,” she answered. “Was he
wrong, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But M. Chassin had flung himself out of the confessional,
his stole in his hand. “M. de Brencourt!” he exclaimed.
Once out he seemed on the verge of some expression better
befitting his late employment as gardener or plotter than
his present as priest. “M. de Brencourt told you—my
child, do not stay kneeling there .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. M. de Brencourt
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. here, sit on this chair and let me hear more of this
extraordinary .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. misunderstanding!—May I know this
great matter—your identity—so long as to speak of it a
little now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was mottled with emotions. Valentine, her
eyes fixed on him, had already risen from her knees and
did sink down on the chair he indicated. In front of her
the candles burnt round the pall and on the altar, ready
for the funeral Mass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Father—but—<span class='it'>misunderstanding</span>!” she caught
at the word. “Is it untrue, then, Father, is it untrue?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not say that, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tell me what M. de Brencourt
said to you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is it untrue—is it untrue?” she repeated piteously.
“O God, is he alive after all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The secret knocked so hard at the door of the priest’s
lips that it seemed to him it must force its way out. It
was cruelty to keep her in this tension—and almost
absurd, too. But he must have a little time to reflect
if he were justified in breaking so solemn a promise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Calm yourself, Madame la Duchesse,” he said, and,
sufficiently agitated himself, sat down beside her. How
extraordinary, how dizzying a sensation to be in the
actual living presence of her whose loss had turned the
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
whole current of his foster-brother’s being. “Tell me
first just what M. de Brencourt said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine put her hands to her head in the effort to
remember exactly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said that M. de Kersaint had told him it was useless
to write to the Duc de Trélan for permission to search
here because he had just heard that the Duc was dead—had
been dead some time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And M. de Brencourt told you that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine’s heart seemed to stand still. “It was false
then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot say, Madame, whether it was false or true,”
responded M. Chassin, “this only, that M. de Brencourt
must have strangely misunderstood M. de Kersaint,
for the Marquis has certainly no grounds for asserting
that the Duc is dead. I do not say that it is not so, but
he has no authority for asserting it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I do not
believe that he ever did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was the mystery? The chapel, the lights, were
beginning to dance round Valentine. The priest guessed
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, this is too much for you. And for me, too.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To learn that you are alive—Let us both try to be
calm. I will do what I came here to do, and though
cannot say a funeral Mass for the Duc de Trélan because
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because I am convinced that he is still alive, I will
say one for his intention and for yours, and for your reunion
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and for wisdom to know how to act,” he
added almost to himself. “But you will give me leave
to retain my knowledge of who you are, will you not?
As you are aware, I must not, having learnt it as I did,
unless you sanction it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not to use it, Father, not to impart to any third
person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even to——” He checked himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to anyone,” said Valentine firmly. “I am no
longer the Duchesse de Trélan. It was necessary, I thought,
that you should know I once was. Now I am Mme Vidal
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said the priest very solemnly, “I implore you,
as your confessor, either to write without loss of time to
M. de Kersaint, telling him who you are, and asking for
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
details about your husband which only he can give you,
or, better still,” his voice shook with earnestness, “to go in
person to Brittany to see him. Believe me, you will be
more than thankful all your life if you do. I will give you
directions afterwards. And now I will finish vesting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine slipped to her knees, and remained sunk
on the kneeling-chair while M. Chassin hastily rolled aside
the pall, put out the great candles, and went into the
sacristy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet in a moment or two he was hurrying out and
bending over the kneeling figure. “Madame, Madame,
I think it must be your bell which is ringing so furiously!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had to repeat it again; but, when once she had
understood, Mme de Trélan was in full possession of her
wits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go at once, Father. It must be something
unusual at this hour. But take off those vestments—leave
the chapel! You must not be found here at any
cost!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fears only for him hurried her out of the chapel and
along the corridor. It was true; her bell was ringing
violently, and it could not be much later than five o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She expected to find outside the door soldiers, or at
least the sentry. The only being there was a rather
indignant small boy, who said reproachfully that he had
been ringing for five minutes, and asked if the gardener
were anywhere about. The child seemed so little the
herald of danger that Valentine said she thought that she
could find him, and asked why he was wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him, please,” said the small messenger, sniffing,
“that his mother in Paris is very ill—dying—and that he
must go at once if he wants to see her alive.” And as
Valentine gave an exclamation he added, “A man has
come from Paris to say this. The gardener must hurry.
That’s all.” And he scampered up the steps again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine hastened out into the passage, relieved to see
in the distance the form of the Abbé, once more a gardener,
coming towards her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is bad news for you, Monsieur l’Abbé, I am sorry
to say,” she exclaimed when he came within hearing.
“Your mother in Paris——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is dying, I suppose,” finished the priest with a strange
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
mixture of concern and irritation. “Do not be distressed,
Madame, for I have no mother. It means something
quite different. I will come into your room for a moment—but
I must leave Mirabel at once.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It means, in
fact,” he went on, once inside, “that the agent in Paris
who has the bulk of the treasure in his possession by now,
and who has the task of transferring it to England, is in
peril of some kind—has probably fallen under suspicion.
There is not a moment to lose if I am to save the money.
Fortunately I had not begun Mass .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Before I go,
however .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He fumbled hastily in a pocket, and
bringing out something wrapped in a scrap of faded silk,
slid the contents out on to the table—a glittering, snake-like
heap of blood and fire and tarnished gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is yours, Madame, by every right. I cannot
take it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine stared at it a moment. “But I do not
need it, Monsieur l’Abbé. Take it with the rest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It would provide for the journey, Madame, which
I implore you to make,” returned M. Chassin, looking at
her hard. “And the directions I promised you—have
you pencil and paper? M. de Kersaint’s headquarters
are now at an old <span class='it'>manoir</span> called le Clos-aux-Grives, near
Lanvennec in Finistère. If you journey in person to Lanvennec
you should go by the route which I am writing
down. In the end you will be directed to a little farm
called the Ferme des Vieilles, not very far from his headquarters,
and on saying there these words in Bas-Breton
all will be made easy for you.” Standing, he wrote for a
moment or two, blessed her, and remained looking at her,
for all his haste, with an expression Valentine could not
decipher—the expression of a man torn by perplexity.
Then he caught her hand, kissed it, and in a very little
had been let out of the door and was hurrying up the
steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mme de Trélan, who had meant to watch him safely
past the sentry, stood oblivious with closed eyes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span></p>

<h2 id='b2c16'>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE QUEEN’S MOVE</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Three days later, about sunset, the Duchesse de Trélan,
her long dead predecessor’s rubies heavy, warm, and
invisible about her neck, stood in the great Salle Verte,
probably for the last time. Only one more day remained
of her strange tenancy of Mirabel—for Camain had made
no sign—and moreover nothing would have kept her
longer now. She was on fire to get to Finistère .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if it
were possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the Abbé she had heard nothing—but she could
expect to hear nothing, unless it were news of his arrest.
No one had seemed perturbed at the non-appearance of
the gardener; possibly no one knew of it. She could
only hope that he had got the treasure away from Paris,
for his coming had so profoundly affected her that she
could not but wish him well. They would meet again,
she supposed, in Brittany, if she ever got there—for,
money apart (and that she had, the reward for Roland)
how was she going to find a means to take her unmolested
from Paris into the furthest fastnesses of the Royalist
West?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mellowed light between afternoon and evening was
pouring in, softening the vista of green marble pillars and
the gilt. Would she ever see the Salle Verte again after
to-morrow? Much had happened there. The great apartment
peopled itself for a space with that throng on her
wedding night, one young and splendid figure outshining
every other man there; it held again the later assemblies
it had seen, the men of note that the Duchesse de
Trélan had known, the soldiers, the diplomats, the courtiers,
the <span class='it'>grandes dames</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all that scarlet-heeled, powdered,
witty, gallant, vicious world, exquisite, debauched and
courteous, everyone of whom, however reluctant or defiant,
had come to the brink of the red torrent which flowed
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
between that life and this, the torrent in which most of
them had been swept away, with so many of the old landmarks,
good or bad, as well. And for a moment Valentine
found herself wondering what this historic room, still
unhurt, unpillaged, might be destined to witness in the
future. No de Trélan, at least, would ever tread its floor
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unless Gaston came back .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some day. He might—he
might! Stranger things had happened. Only it
was certain that he would never come back under any
conditions that involved a pact with the spoilers.
No exile, no hardships, nothing that she could imagine
would have changed that trait in him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A step, a heavy, hasty step, broke into her reverie—a
step that had not been her way of late. It could only
be one person’s. She turned, and saw M. Georges Camain
advancing along the line of pillars towards her, wearing a
face of thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine’s heart sank. She went a few paces to meet
him, and he stayed his advance, and, beckoning to her in a
manner quite devoid of his usual objectionable gallantry,
walked back to the great hearth and took up by his stand
by it. Evidently he felt the middle of so vast an apartment
no place for a scene, and that there was going to be
a scene was written on his whole demeanour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Madame Vidal?” He threw the words at her
like a challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She met his look with composure, and answered, “Yes,
Citizen Deputy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Citizen Deputy,” he mimicked her angrily.
“The Citizen Deputy wants to know what you have done
with the gardener who was working here a few days ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have done nothing with him, Citizen. He has not
been here for the last three days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed? And do you know why he left?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A messenger came to say that his mother in Paris
was dying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mother!</span>” said Camain, exploding. “Mother dying!
You have the impudence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Shall I tell you, since you
are so persistently innocent, why he left? His plans
in Paris were threatened, and you know what those plans
were, and his work here, too, as well as I—no, by God,
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
better, since I have not yet had time to investigate his
operations at Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plans? Work?” repeated Valentine. “Do you
refer to the Italian——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” broke in the ex-Jacobin savagely, “don’t
trifle with me like that, woman! I say you know what
he came to do, and you helped him to do it, and to get
away with his booty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he had got away .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or did Camain only mean
from Mirabel? Valentine made no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you answer me?” barked her late
admirer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are so positive, Citizen Deputy, what is the
use? It is of little avail for me to protest—though you
must know it quite well—that I had no hand in the appointment
of this gardener who seems to have displeased you,
nor in the carrying out of his ‘work,’ whatever it may
have been, except that I used to give him a cup of coffee
with his meal at mid-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, just as out of the same pure kindness you opened
the door in the park wall to let one or the other of the rest
out or in—just as you fooled me into saving you from
being confronted with the man who broke into the sallette,
your accomplice, whom you invited here, I expect——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” interrupted Valentine firmly. “I had
nothing to do with his coming, any more than with that
of the gardener.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Camain would not listen. “Then, like a fool, I gave you
thirty days in which you were assured of my absence—incredible
idiot that I was! And this is the use you have
made of them!” His towering rage seemed almost as
much with himself as with her; but his scowl was not
pleasant to sustain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I appoint the gardener, Citizen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not the question. He got his appointment by
chicanery, used it to search Mirabel for hidden treasure
in the interests of the Royalists, and you furthered his
researches—you who asked me so guilelessly a little time
ago for what reason that other man could have broken in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I absolutely deny that I furthered his researches in
any way,” retorted Valentine with spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you did not actually go and help him dig,” retorted
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
Camain, scowling worse than ever, “you knew of his purpose,
and it was your duty to tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if it was,” said Valentine reflectively, almost
more to herself than to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The irate Georges stared at her a second in amazement.
“You are a cool hand!” he exclaimed. “You wonder
if it was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when I am paying you to look after the
place”—a flush rose in Valentine’s cheek—“and when
now, in consequence of your silence, if not of your complicity,
I am myself in a most unenviable position!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry to hear that, Monsieur le Député,” said
Valentine gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deuced good of you! It never occurred to you,
I suppose, that I was responsible to the Government for
Mirabel—even when I was taking down that worthless
deposition of yours? Still, you have shown me pretty
clearly once that my concerns are less than nothing to
you. But let me tell you that, if there is an enquiry, someone
else—to whom I begin to think you are under a very
heavy debt indeed—will probably come off badly, and
that is Suzon Tessier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned an alarmed face on him. “Not Suzon!
What had she to do with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This, that she has had you under her roof for nearly
seven years as her ‘aunt,’ and that it was from her house
that you were taken off to prison as a suspected aristocrat.
Yes, you see I know that now—not from Suzon, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are not in the Terror now,” said Valentine uneasily.
Could Suzon really be in danger?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but we may go back to it before long if these crazy
young Royalist reactionaries become more troublesome.
There were quantities of <span class='it'>collets noirs</span> in that fracas with
the Jacobins of the Société du Manège last month. <span class='it'>You</span>
may approve of those antics, but they will lead to—repression.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what am I to do?” asked Valentine. “I deny
complicity with the persons who came here, but truth or
falsehood, as I know, has little to do with the verdict of a
revolutionary jury, and for nothing in the world would I
have Suzon suffer on my account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Camain took a turn up and down, his arms folded.
“Yes, what can you do?” he asked sarcastically. “Rather
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
late to think of that now! Well, I think the best thing
you can do, Madame Vidal, is to vanish. If there is an
enquiry, which I shall do my best to prevent for my own
sake, Suzon had better not be able to produce you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine’s heart gave a leap. Was it possible that he,
of all people, might be interested in her going to Finistère?
A few moments ago her chances of an interview with the
Marquis de Kersaint had seemed very remote indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how can I vanish in a moment?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Camain came nearer, and looked down at her with searching,
half mocking eyes. “Have you no friends, no aristocratic
kin who would shelter you? Cannot you go back
to that ‘provincial town’ from which you came to be
Suzon’s aunt? Difficult to find again, I fancy! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It
must be a complete, a good disappearance—you must not
be caught.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To fulfil that requirement, Monsieur le Député, there
is no place but the grave. I do not propose to kill myself,
nor, I suppose, are you asking that of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An unwilling smile came over the heavy, angry visage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Corbleu, I was right in admiring you! Yes, there is
no place but the grave for that. I am not asking you to
journey so far. But you understand that, if you vanish, you
will, in a sense, assume some of the guilt of these happenings
at Mirabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I understand. And that is what you want,
Citizen, in order to take it off your shoulders—and Suzon’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can scarcely regard yourself, in that case, as
an innocent scapegoat, can you, Madame Vidal?” he
suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not answer this, but said, with a beating heart
and outward calm, “There is a place to which I could go—a
place far enough away, where I should not, probably, be
found. But how, without a passport or papers of any kind,
am I to get there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Papers!” he said half sneeringly. “Plenty of
Royalist agents in Paris would forge you those.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know any Royalist agents in Paris, Citizen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again so innocent! Do you expect <span class='it'>me</span> to provide
you with papers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt if you could,” answered Valentine. “I
expect nothing—but I do wish to preserve Suzon from ill.”
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“And me?” suggested Camain. “No, I am not much
above a bricklayer by origin—no stewards to the aristocracy
in <span class='it'>my</span> family! Well, Madame Vidal, since I am fond
of Suzon, and since I was misguided enough to admire you,
and since I am not indifferent to the safety of my own
skin, I can give you a paper .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at a price. I have
here,” he brought out a pocket-case, “a blank laissez-passer
that I once got out of Barras when he was particularly
in need of cash. That would carry you anywhere
as long as the Directory stands, but it cost me a deal of
money. The question is, how much is it worth to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchesse’s hand went involuntarily to the neck of
her dress. Was it for this that the Abbé had left her the
necklace?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not mean in money,” said Camain, watching her.
“If you really want this paper—and you ought to want
it, for it would be beyond price to a person in your situation—you
will be willing to give me in exchange for it what I
conceive you value most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine changed colour a little. “And what is that?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your secret,” said the Deputy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at him, bereft of speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By that I mean—your real name,” explained M.
Camain. “You cannot flatter yourself that, by this time,
I do not almost know it. Did you not realise when you
refused my suit, when you were for once your real self,
how you betrayed your origin? That scorn——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not scorn of you, Monsieur Camain,” she broke
in quickly. “You mistook me. I did not resent your
offer, but the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the grounds on which you based it.
However, it is no good going back to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the Deputy, looking at her as she stood
there by the blazoned and defaced hearth, so plainly
dressed, yet clothed with the grace and dignity that never
left her. “No, it is no use going back to that. But, to be
frank with you, even after your treatment of me the other
day in the garden, I meant to renew my suit. I told myself
that a man,” involuntarily he drew himself up, “is a man
after all, and we are every one equal in these days. But
now, I think you are too clever for the wife of a bourgeois,
and too innately ci-devant after all, in spite of the life
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
you have lived of late, and your conciergeship and the
rest. There is, as the Scripture says, a great gulf fixed
between us. I was aiming too high, was I not, Madame
la .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what was the title you used to bear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine did not answer, but said very gravely indeed,
turning her gaze full on him. “There is indeed a great
gulf fixed, Monsieur le Député, between such as you are
and such as I. It is filled with blood—and mostly with
innocent blood—the blood of my class .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shed by
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Georges Camain shifted uneasily. “There may have
been mistakes,” he muttered, and Valentine wondered
for a second over what private and accusing memories of
his own his mind went glancing as he looked at the floor.
“But come,” he said, recovering himself, “we must keep
to business. I can replace you to-morrow, and you can
start to-morrow. You observe I do not ask your destination.
To get there, wherever it be, you have only to show
this paper. It will open any gate to you, for that dissolute
scoundrel’s signature is still all-powerful. You have only
to tell me, Madame Vidal, what you called yourself in the
days before you became Suzon Tessier’s aunt, and it is
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” said Valentine slowly, “if my name should
chance not to please you, you would have me arrested
at once, before I had an opportunity of using your
paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the worst of you ci-devants,” said the Deputy,
in something resembling his former jocular tones. “So
suspicious. You won’t trust the People .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do not
know what oath I can swear to you. And why should an
oath be needed; it is to my interest and my cousin’s to
get you away. Moreover I am a Theophilanthropist and
you, I expect, a Catholic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we both believe in a God at least,” said Mme
de Trélan. “Swear to me, Monsieur Camain, by the God
we both believe in, that you will make no use of my name
if I tell it to you, that you will betray it to no one else,
that you will give me the paper and not hinder my departure,
and I will tell you my secret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Camain raised his hand. “I swear all this, by the
God in Whom we both believe, and by the white head of
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
my old mother down in Angers, who still prays, I think,
to your Catholic Virgin for her son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine looked away from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am the woman who best has a right to be in Mirabel,”
she said, with her eyes on the phoenix over the escutcheon
where her own arms of Fondragon were quartered with all
the rest. “This house—this hearth—knows no name but
the name I bear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what in the wide universe
do you mean?” ejaculated Camain, open-mouthed and
recoiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His protégée turned and faced him. “I mean that
I am the Duchesse de Trélan,” she said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barras’ signature, turning upon itself in its descent,
fluttered from the Deputy’s paralysed hand to the floor
between them.</p>

<h3>THE COURT OF CHARLEMAGNE</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Because it was both midday and high summer, the
thrushes that gave its pretty name to the old farmhouse of
Le Clos-aux-Grives, near Lanvennec in Finistère, were not
singing; and though the same hour of noon which silenced
them called insistently for some voice from the large iron
cooking-pot that hung over the fire in the living-room, the
pot also was mute. Yet Lucien du Boisfossé, wearing as
serious a face as that which he had bent over the <span class='it'>Æneid</span>
at Hennebont, was seated on a stool near it, almost under
the deep recessed hearth, and from time to time he would
rise, take off the lid, and peer into its contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youthful cook was not alone in the big, low room—far
from it. On one of the aged black oak settles that ran
out at right angles from the hearth was seated Artamène
de la Vergne, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees
and a riding-switch between his hands. He was regarding
his friend’s occupation with much the same amused
criticism which he had bestowed on Roland’s bedmaking
in M. Charlot’s attic four months ago. And at least a
dozen other gentlemen, some quite young, some in the
thirties or forties, were also in the room, talking and
laughing. For though the three treasure-seekers who had
formed part of the smaller gathering at Hennebont were
still missing, their places, as far as numbers went, were
amply filled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The projects which had been discussed with Georges
Cadoudal on that occasion were in a fair way of realisation
to-day. Finistère <span class='it'>was</span> in process of organisation—at the
cost of weeks of unremitting toil and danger, in which
M. de Kersaint had personally traversed all the wildest
districts of the department. As far as the promise of men
went, the harvest was good, but, as usual, the pinch came
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
over arming them—and Mirabel had not yet yielded up
its treasure. The chief source of encouragement, however,
lay in the aspect of the political situation: the effect
produced by the numerous Austrian and Russian victories
of the spring and summer—not yet indeed come to an
end, for it was the eve of Novi; the weariness of the
country, still groaning under a detested but tottering
government; the hopes based on the important Royalist
movement centred in Bordeaux, which embraced Toulouse
and Languedoc, and not a little, too, on the revulsion
caused by the cruel operation of the Law of Hostages of
July 12, which actually forced recruits into the Chouan
camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the other Royalist leaders many were still in England.
And the Marquis de Kersaint was not advertising himself;
with the means at his disposal—for in no one place
could he hope to get together a really formidable force—his
aim, when the time came, was to surprise rather than
to defy. Weeks, however, would probably elapse before
concerted action was taken, and meanwhile he had still
to find most of the arms and ammunition required. And,
though he had his staff round him here, his men, his <span class='it'>gars</span>,
were, with certain exceptions, going about their usual
avocations, cultivating their farms or preparing for harvest.
Only, one day, when the whisper went round, the
hoe and sickle would lie idle in the fields, and he who had
been a small farmer would turn up in the likeness of a
brigand at the rallying-place—Galoppe-la-Frime or Frappe
d’Abord the Chouan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one thing alone was M. de Kersaint singular, in that
he already had a regular headquarters and was able to
occupy it unmolested. Even Cadoudal and his subordinates
in the Morbihan judged it prudent to leave theirs
by night, and sleep dispersed in the forest. That M. de
Kersaint and his officers could remain with impunity at the
Clos-aux-Grives, that despatches found their way there
and that it was the discreet centre of a continual going
and coming of emissaries, as the work of organisation
advanced towards completion, was owing to the fact
that it stood in furthest Finistère, the most remote and
untouched part of the intractable West. It was too difficult
for the Blues, as they were termed, to get at it.
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, in this large farm-house, once a <span class='it'>manoir</span>, all but
the superior officers of M. de Kersaint’s staff were awaiting
their noontide meal this August day. The old greenish
glass in the tiny panes admitted a tempered light, but
the room was large enough to have windows on both
sides, and it was a pleasant apartment. At night it was
used as a dormitory by the younger officers, who slept
on pallets on the floor, for which reason, and also because
it was mainly ‘les jeunes’ who inhabited it at any time,
M. du Ménars, acting second-in-command till the Comte
de Brencourt’s return, had christened it ‘the nursery’—earning
thereby small gratitude from Lucien and Artamène
and their peers. On the long table, dark with the polish
of ages, were set platters, horn spoons and forks, bowls
of the cheerful Quimper ware, and jugs of cider, but the
meal, whatever its nature, seemed to be dependent on the
boiling of Lucien’s pot, to which process, indeed, other
eyes than Artamène’s were directed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de la Vergne himself was moved at last to expostulate,
though as a matter of fact he had only come into the
‘nursery’ five minutes before. Stretching out an arm,
he tapped the pot with his switch, and said gently, “What
is in this receptacle, my good Lucien? Stones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure I don’t know,” replied M. du Boisfossé in a
rather exasperated voice. “They brought it in here from
the kitchen, and said it would finish cooking nicely, if I
would just see that the fire was kept up. And I’ve put
sticks and sticks on the wretched thing——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And blacked your face into the bargain,” finished his
friend brutally. “I expect it is the mortal part of that
superannuated cow I have seen about.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Never mind,
time conquers all things, even cows. Put on yet more
sticks, and while the old lady simmers I will tell you a piece
of news. M. le Marquis is going to recall—you can guess
whom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not our long-lost Roland?” exclaimed Lucien, starting
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Artamène nodded. “If you agitate yourself, mon ami,
you will knock your head against the hearth next. Yes,
it appears that the convalescent adventurer has written
him so penitent and piteous a letter from Kerlidec that our
leader’s heart is softened, and he is writing to tell Roland
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
that he may rejoin us. You have heard, of course,
gentlemen,” he went on, addressing a little group of newly-joined
young officers who had strolled over to the hearth,
“how our paladin was unhorsed at Roncesvalles—that
is to say, winged by the guard of the enchanted castle of
Mirabel. But he did not fall into the hands of the Saracens,
like M. de Brencourt, his successor, for the princess who
inhabits the same, in other words, the concierge, taking
pity on him, nursed and smuggled him out of Mirabel again
to his relatives in Paris. Thence, when he was sufficiently
recovered, the poor Roland returned home to, I am afraid,
a very irate grandparent.—Keep the dowager going,
Lucien!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now you say that Charlemagne has relented, and
is going to summon him here?” said Lucien, taking up his
friend’s metaphor. “What a mercy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose M. le Marquis has been anxious about M. de
Céligny?” suggested one of the newcomers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, very anxious—and more than anxious, exceedingly
angry,” replied M. du Boisfossé. “Isn’t that so,
Artamène.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parbleu!” remarked M. de la Vergne, making a
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean angry with you, Chevalier?” pursued the
enquirer. “Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I had a hand in M. de Céligny’s enterprise,”
explained Artamène, sighing gently. “I would fain have
shared it altogether, but I was winged myself then. We
planned it together in our retirement last spring—if what
we had to leave so largely to chance can be said to have
had a plan. And then, when Roland had set out, his
grandfather wrote to the Marquis to know what had become
of him, and M. le Marquis sent to me, and out it all came
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at least, most of it. I said that Roland had gone to
visit his cousins in Paris, which was true, but not, I must
confess, the whole truth. If I may venture a counsel,
gentlemen, to such of you as are newcomers, always tell
the whole truth when you are dealing with M. le Marquis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when did <span class='it'>you</span> tell the whole truth, then, La
Vergne?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I came here,” replied Artamène. He beat a
little tattoo on one boot with his riding-switch, and added
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
in a feeling voice, but with a laugh in the corner of his eye,
“—a memorable day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dies nefas</span>,” commented Lucien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And M. de Kersaint was displeased with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Displeased!</span>” exclaimed the culprit. “Had I possessed
the gift of metamorphosis the shape of a mouse, a
spider—of a gnat, even—had speedily been mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A laugh went round his audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” objected someone, “I do not see in your case,
Chevalier, the reason for this excessive wrath at which you
hint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for one thing,” returned Artamène pensively,
“M. le Marquis had definitely forbidden either of us to go
to Mirabel, whereas I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and my family .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. had
certainly encouraged Roland’s expedition. Then the
Marquis seemed to consider also that I had deceived him
about Roland by merely telling him of his visit to those
confounded cousins (which of course I did solely to shield
Roland). In fact he characterised my conduct by a very
unpleasant term which I am not going to repeat. (However,
we have since made it up, Charlemagne and I.)
And thirdly, to such of us as have seen them together, it is
undeniable that between M. le Marquis and the Vicomte
de Céligny there subsists——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chut!” said the prudent Lucien, holding up a finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mais, au nom de Dieu, pourquoi <span class='it'>chut</span>?” demanded
Artamène in a voice of injured innocence. “I was merely
going to say that there subsisted between them a special
affection, of which I, for one, am not in the least jealous.
What is the harm in that remark?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody present either condemned or absolved him, but
one or two who in the spring had seen the couple together
turned away to hide a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I still cannot quite understand,” remarked Lucien
judicially, “how this good fairy of a concierge came to be
inhabiting Mirabel. I thought that the place was in the
hands of the Directory, and surely their nominee——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall have to wait until the Abbé or M. de Brencourt
returns to discover that,” said Artamène. “I gathered
that M. le Marquis expects the latter any day now; it
seems, from what the Abbé wrote, a foregone conclusion
that he would succeed in escaping from the Temple.”
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” asked Lucien, his head almost in the procrastinating
pot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mainly by the use of the root of all evil, mon cher—in
plainer language, by bribery. I thought you knew
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And M. le Comte did not get the treasure from Mirabel?”
asked a newcomer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, the booty is left to the Church to secure. And,
do you know, I shall stake my money on the Church’s
success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish Roland could have got it,” murmured Lucien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” said Artamène. “So does .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my family.”
He got up and stretched himself. “But, dear me, we were
very young last spring! I am older now, and wiser—much
wiser. And as for poor Roland, he must have
attained to such a pitch of sagacity that——” He suddenly
stopped and remained fixed, his arms extended,
and, staring at an open casement said, “Morbleu, talk of
the devil!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” exclaimed several voices, their owners
following his gaze, while Lucien sprang up and had exactly
that encounter with the overhanging hearth which his
friend had predicted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I be shot if that is not the Comte de Brencourt
in person, just ridden into the courtyard!” And Artamène
dashed to the window, followed by almost everybody
else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in a moment he had turned away again, shaking his
head. “Too late!” he said disappointedly. “He will
go straight to M. le Marquis now. Besides, he did not
look as if he would be communicative; he had his mouth
shut like a strongbox.” And he regretfully strolled back
to the fire, which the sedulous Lucien had not deserted.
“Good Heavens, philosopher, isn’t that soufflé of yours
cooked yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said M. du Boisfossé, prodding about with a
fork, one hand pressed to his head, “that I shall assume
the process.”
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span></p>

<h2 id='b3c2'>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>M. DE KERSAINT ANSWERS FOR A KINSMAN</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>About the time that the contents of Lucien’s pot were
becoming only a tough memory, the Marquis de Kersaint
was standing, with his hands behind his back, looking out
through the casement of the small room on the upper
floor of the Clos-aux-Grives which was set apart for his
sole use, and out of which led a still smaller bedroom.
Under his gaze was the farmyard, still stocked with chickens
and pigs, and then, almost at once, came the outposts of
the great forest which stretched for many miles to the
south-west, and whose friendly presence had been one of his
reasons for his choice of headquarters. From the window
of the inner room could be seen also the low bare contours
of the lande, studded with menhirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint, however, was not occupied with the
view. He was thinking about the singularly unsatisfactory
interview which he had just had with his returned chief of
staff. For M. de Brencourt would hardly answer any
questions about his doings, seemed to know almost nothing
of the unusual concierge at Mirabel (of whom, and of whose
services to Roland M. de Kersaint had heard from the
Abbé) and, when taxed with having written from the
Temple, as he had, a letter dissuading his leader from
sending another emissary after the treasure, could only
reply that he supposed, at his age, captivity was extinguishing
to the sense of adventure. And, when closer pressed
as to why he had stated in so many words that the gold
was impossible to get at and the place closely guarded,
whereas the Abbé had just written exactly the opposite,
he had made no answer at all. Decidedly, in view of the
effect which Mirabel had had on him, it would have been
better not to have sent him at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis turned at last from the window. He had
discarded the peasant’s dress now-a-days, and wore a dark-green
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
uniform with black facings, with the little red and
white ribbon of the Order of Maria Theresa on the breast,
and a white scarf round the waist. Out of a small travelling
safe near the window he took some letters, and re-read
Roland de Céligny’s ashamed appeal with something
between a smile and a frown. After that, obeying the
instinct which so often pushes a man to do what hurts
him, he re-read also the three biting epistles from M. de
Carné which Roland’s action had brought upon him. The
first was thus conceived:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:left;margin-left:1em;'>“<span class='it'>Monsieur le ‘Marquis,’</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>I am most reluctant to enter into a correspondence
with you, but as I am confined to my bed with an attack of
gout, I cannot carry out my first intention of coming in
person to see you. Six days have now passed since you
disbanded your cohort of young men, yet Roland has not
been sent back to me according to the promise on which I
was weak enough to rely. Where is the boy?</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This was the first intimation which the Marquis had
received that Roland was missing. Alarmed and angry,
he wrote to the old man in that sense, but his disclaimer
did not prevent his meanwhile receiving a second missive,
now in his hand. “<span class='it'>I find by a letter which has just reached
me from my grandson, that instead of sending him back to
me, you have despatched him on a secret and doubtless dangerous
mission to Paris, for that he can really have gone of his
own initiative, as he says, I refuse to believe. I regret that
my present infirmity, by making it impossible for me to offer
you satisfaction, renders it impossible also for me to tell you
what I think of your conduct—though, to be frank, that
conduct does not surprise me.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint, greatly roused, had answered that for
his part he regretted his respect for the Baron’s grey hairs
should prevent his replying in the strain to which he was
tempted, stating, however, that he did not send Roland
to Paris, that on the contrary he had forbidden him to go,
that he had only that day heard of his disobedience, and
that he was at once instituting enquiries after him in the
capital. His anxiety and his displeasure, he added, were
not less than M. de Carné’s own.
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>To which the old man had replied with brevity and
effect:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I have only to say that, to my bitter grief, I see at last in
Roland the dawn of those qualities whose appearance I have
always so much dreaded. He is indeed his father’s son.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even now the reader flushed as his eyes met this thrust,
and he had been far angrier when he first received it—angry
with himself too for having protected his own honour
by revealing the boy’s disobedience. He might as well
have taken the blame on his own shoulders, since the old
man had contrived after all to put the responsibility there—on
the score of that paternity which, during that visit
to Kerlidec last February, M. de Carné had at length been
obliged to acknowledge.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had it not been for the existence of Roland himself that
brief amour with Laure de Céligny, more than twenty
years ago, would have seemed now as unreal as a dream.
It had come to pass so suddenly, been over so soon. Down
there at Saint-Chamans, in the south of olives and nightingales
and orange blossom (the south to which, for some
reason, his wife so unwillingly and so seldom accompanied
him) passion flared up quickly. Yet of the Vicomtesse Laure
alone, among the many women who had loved him and the
few he had loved, Gaston de Trélan had a particularly
gentle memory. She had seemed to him like a dove in a
cypress-tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The episode ended. That it had ever been was not
discovered till Laure’s sudden death, coming to light
then only through the single letter her lover had written her,
which (of course) she had kept. M. de Céligny wrote to
him. The Duc de Trélan posted down from Paris to the
olives and the nightingales and offered him satisfaction.
Very greatly to his surprise it was refused. The Vicomte
de Céligny—the cypress-tree—intimated that, though he
had proof enough that M. de Trélan had been his wife’s
lover, he had none that Roland (now two years old) was
not his own son. He should consider him his own, and
a duel, whatever its result, could only bring disrepute on
the name of his dead wife. Roland should succeed to his
estates, and the Duc had no claim on him whatever. A
strange interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was, and for three years the Duc heard nothing
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
more, and never visited his possessions in the south. Then
he learnt, incidentally, that the child had been sent to his
grandfather in Brittany to be brought up. The move,
after de Céligny’s declaration, puzzled him extremely, and
in the end he went to Kerlidec to investigate the matter.
The fiery temper of the Baron de Carné, who had worshipped
his dead daughter, led to the meeting which his son-in-law
had declined, and the fact that Gaston de Trélan, a singularly
fine swordsman, and a much younger man than
himself (being then about six-and-thirty) disarmed him
with ease, only increased M. de Carné’s bitter resentment
against him as the seducer—so he termed him—of his
Laure. No more than his son-in-law would he acknowledge
the Duc’s claim on the child, and forbade him, if he
had any regard for Laure’s memory, to see the boy again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But M. de Trélan had seen the five-year-old Roland at
that very visit, and the sight was enough to explain why
M. de Céligny had sent him away. At that age more than
later, his resemblance to his real father was unmistakable;
apparently M. de Céligny had not been able to bear this
speaking witness to his wife’s frailty, though it seemed
that he had not moved from his intention of acknowledging
him as his heir. To M. de Carné the beautiful boy was
merely the child of his beloved Laure.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Duc said
that he would undertake not to see him again during his
supposed father’s lifetime; further than that he would not
go. He had kept his word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now he could claim, had claimed, if not the full
rights of a father—for he had promised not to reveal his
relationship till Roland was of age—at least some control
over his movements. It was doubly unfortunate then,
that Roland had acted as he had about Mirabel. Was
it true that he had handed down to the boy his own bad
qualities—left conveniently unnamed in that stinging
remark of M. de Carné’s? At any rate, he thought now
with a bitter smile, “I have not yet seen traces in the sweet-tempered
Roland of being his grandfather’s grandson.”
And, lighting a candle, he burnt the Baron’s three letters
to ashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was a fourth—that which had come with
Roland’s—and it was couched in a milder vein. Roland
had evidently succeeded in convincing his grandfather
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
that the Marquis de Kersaint was far indeed from having
had a hand in his escapade, and the Baron had consequently
penned a rather stiff apology for his former insinuations,
and, in addition, an obviously reluctant request for Roland’s
recall to the Royalist colours, since he was, he confessed,
eating his heart out at Kerlidec. M. de Kersaint had
thereupon recalled the culprit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, in a week now, he might expect Roland in person.
He must do his best to show him just the amount of
severity that he would have done to Lucien or Artamène,
no less and no more. It would not be easy. The boy’s
misdemeanour sprang after all from no worse fault than
want of thought, and its very foolhardiness went far to
redeem it. Suppose he had paid for it with his life!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he locked the safe, the Marquis said to himself,
“How am I ever going to repay that woman for saving the
child?”</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. le Général Marquis de Kersaint and M. le Comte de
Brencourt supped together that evening. The latter was
no longer a treasure-hunter; he was M. de Kersaint’s
second-in-command, and he had been out of touch with
his leader and the organisation of Finistère for some weeks.
He had to be initiated into the present state of Royalist
affairs in the department, and there were also a quantity of
other matters to discuss: the proposed Anglo-Russian
landing at the Texel, and how it would affect the West,
how much weight Pichegru’s name would carry when he
appeared as a Royalist, and as ever, the difficulties created
by the vacillating conduct of the Comte d’Artois’ advisers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And over their meal they did discuss these, but, as they
were neither of them men to waste words on a situation,
they got through pretty quickly, and towards the end
of the repast the Comte was able to gratify the curious
desire he now seemed to have to talk about Mirabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A monstrous fine place, you know, Marquis,” he
observed for the second time, refilling his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it?” said M. de Kersaint with indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you must realise that it is!” retorted the Comte.
“You speak as if you had never seen it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seen it very seldom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is so, then, parbleu, you have an astounding
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
memory for topographical details! The accuracy of the
plan of the interior you made for me was astounding,
considering that you had only been there once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never said, surely, that I had only been there once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your pardon, then. You gave me to understand as
much, I thought, when you drew me the plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I? I have no recollection of having said so, for
as a matter of fact I must have been there quite three times
in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte smiled curiously. “Your plan becomes
less miraculous then. But even so, the owner or someone
must have conducted you into every hole and corner on
the ground floor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this deduction M. de Kersaint made no response.
The Comte drank off a glass of wine, and then, just perceptibly
taking a breath as one addressing himself to a
plunge, said, “Did you ever see the Duchesse during any
of your—three visits?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied the Marquis, his eyes on the stem of his
wineglass. “She was not there. She was often elsewhere.
They had several other properties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great pity,” observed M. de Brencourt meaningly,
“that she was not elsewhere in August, ’92. Why in
God’s name did she not emigrate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Comte, how can I say?” retorted M. de
Kersaint, twisting the wineglass round and round. (Had
he turned paler?)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” said his companion reflectively, “if her
husband ever gave her the chance of going with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How can a man in mental agony, however proud and
determined, suppress every sign of what he is suffering?
Yet only a very close observer could have seen the throbbing
of the vein at the Marquis de Kersaint’s temple. And this
observer, though watching as the proverbial cat the mouse,
missed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to forget,” returned M. de Kersaint rather
haughtily, “that my kinsman is a gentleman. And, for
the matter of that, the Duchesse could have gone at any
time between ’90 and ’92.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite true. And might be alive now had she done so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So might many other people, if it comes to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a wise precaution, certainly, leaving France.
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
I suppose one may say you owe <span class='it'>your</span> life to it, de
Kersaint?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly,” said his leader shortly. “More probably
I owe it to Josef Schnitterl. Pass me the wine if you
have done with it, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte’s glance lit for an instant on the scrap of
ribbon on the speaker’s breast. It was Schnitterl, the
Marquis’s Austrian body-servant—not long ago serving
their meal—who, as he was never tired of relating, had
found his master half-dead on the battlefield of Rivoli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Mme de Trélan had emigrated,” the tormentor pursued,
“the Duc would be spared the burden of remorse
which he carries—or does not carry, as the case may be.”
With that he pushed the bottle of wine towards his companion
and looked him full in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But M. de Kersaint, though rather white about the
mouth, met the look quite steadily. “Thank you,” he
said, taking the bottle. But he offered no remark on the
subject of the Duc de Trélan’s problematical burden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know, de Kersaint,” shot out the Comte suddenly,
watching him as he filled his glass, “that there is a
portrait at Mirabel which reminded me very strongly of
you—of what you must have been when you were younger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you know I am kin to the family.” He had not
spilled a drop of wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But by marriage only!” riposted the Comte like lightning.
“You laid some stress on that once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis shrugged his shoulders. “You forgot
that, I expect, when you thought you saw a likeness.
Some people,” he pursued with commendable sangfroid,
“are always seeing resemblances of that sort in relations
by marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! Well, you might have sat for this picture!
I saw it when I was arrested, for I was taken up into the
room where all your—I mean your kinsman’s—family
portraits now hang. Camain, the Deputy of whom I have
told you, happened to be there with a party of friends,
including his bonne amie, Mlle Dufour—the actress, Rose
Dufour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was piquant to see her there, with her great bourgeois
admirer, going round the Duc’s china under the eyes
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
of all his ancestors—<span class='it'>and under someone else’s, too</span>,” he added
mentally, “and must have been even more piquant for
her—the Duc’s former mistress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His mistress!” exclaimed M. de Kersaint sharply.
“That she never was!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte looked a rather mocking surprise. He had
not expected to draw de Kersaint thus, for he believed
what he said. “What, you can answer for your kinsman’s
private life to that extent, Marquis! You must have
known him pretty well, then, after all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew him well enough to be sure that that story
has no foundation,” retorted his companion with a frown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Was he then such a puritan, the Duc de
Trélan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not. But every man draws the line somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” observed M. de Brencourt, looking down with
a smile at the tablecloth. “Your noble relative thought
too highly of himself to lay his purse at the feet of an opera
singer, yet he did not scruple to leave his wife to years of
penury. The world, as you must recognise, would have
thought nothing of the first—a mere peccadillo—the
second——” He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Obsessed with the ineffaceable picture of the Duchesse
in her shabby dress, he looked up to see how it was faring
with his victim after this venomous thrust. The latter
was gazing at him, sufficiently ghastly indeed, but with
so much astonishment that the Comte realised his
slip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Years of penury!” said the Marquis harshly. “What
are you talking of, de Brencourt? Mme de Trélan was
amply provided for during the two years of the Duc’s
emigration, and at her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. death” (it was evident that
he could scarcely bring out the word) “she certainly was
not poor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at that M. de Brencourt himself went white. Good
Heavens, supposing that in the delight of torturing him
he let out something vital, as he had almost done now.
He must curb his tongue. “No, no, that is true, I suppose,”
he stammered. “I ought to beg M. de Trélan’s
pardon for saying that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you ought to beg his pardon for a good deal
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
else that you have said about him,” remarked M. de
Trélan’s kinsman stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, so I would, perhaps,—if he were here,” replied
M. de Brencourt, shutting his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His leader looked at him contemptuously for a moment,
then he said, “It is perhaps fortunate that he is not.—Well,
did you collect any more <span class='it'>chroniques scandaleuses</span> at
Mirabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colour returned to the Comte’s face under the tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. One item, however, may interest you—as a
kinsman by marriage. Her portrait is no longer at
Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose portrait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The late Duchesse’s.” His secret felt safer now behind
that adjective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment’s pause. “What had happened to it then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the mob broke in that day, the mob which she
had to face alone—picture it, de Kersaint!—some ruffian
with a pike dashed his weapon through it. No doubt he
would have liked——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told you that—about the portrait?” interrupted
the Marquis, setting down his glass. He had not drunk;
and this time there was a stain on the cloth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told me?—The concierge,” replied M. de Brencourt
after a second’s hesitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, this concierge about whom you are so unwilling
to tell me anything, although the Abbé’s success or failure
may possibly depend upon her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unwilling—I!” exclaimed the Comte harshly. “There
is nothing to tell. She did not save me, like Roland.”
A sneer crept into his voice. “And probably in Roland’s
case it was merely that he is a taking youth, and she felt
compassion for him, or——” An idea seemed suddenly
to come into his mind that struck him silent for a moment;
then with half a laugh he muttered, “No, morbleu, it
could hardly have been that! On the contrary!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mysterious,” observed his leader coldly.
“And I repeat that, since you knew this friendly woman
to be in charge at Mirabel, I cannot understand your trying
to dissuade me from a further attempt on the treasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt looked at the ceiling. “Possibly you
cannot,” he returned very slowly. “But I remembered
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
that one woman had already gone to prison—and worse—from
Mirabel, and I did not——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis leant forward. “Do you mean to insinuate,”
he said hotly, “that I wish to make use of a woman
and leave her to pay? Because if so, Monsieur de Brencourt——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He checked himself abruptly. “Come in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knock at the door had heralded Lucien du Boisfossé,
who stood there saluting and signifying that the <span class='it'>chef de
canton</span> called ‘Sincèree’ had sent a messenger who would
like to speak to the General at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show him up,” said M. de Kersaint. “No—wait!
I’ll see him downstairs. Excuse me, Comte.” And he
was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt looked after him with an unpleasant
smile; then he poured himself out another glass of wine
and drank it down.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Next evening M. du Ménars and another officer were also
at supper.

<h2 id='b3c3'>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>M. DE KERSAINT ANSWERS FOR HIMSELF</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Lucien du Boisfossé and Artamène de la Vergne would
not have been themselves—particularly Artamène—if
they had not remarked, during the next few days, that a
state of curious restraint had come into existence between
their leader and his chief of staff, the Comte de Brencourt.
Indeed, apart from any intercourse that he held with M.
de Kersaint, no one could fail to see that the Comte had
returned from his mission another and a much less agreeable
person. As Artamène remarked, he had never been
genial in his manners, but at least he had some manners;
now he seemed to have left them with the abandoned
treasure at Mirabel. His moodiness and irritability vented
themselves on all his subordinates, and he would harry
gentleman and peasant alike for not saluting with sufficient
precision, or not mounting guard properly. Indeed, the
Chevalier de la Vergne opined that there might be a mutiny
among the Chouans, caused for no other reason than that
M. de Brencourt had something on his mind—was <span class='it'>rongé</span>
with something or other, as he put it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To what it could be that was thus gnawing at him the
two young men then applied their wits, and, suddenly
remembering that night at Hennebont, arrived without
much trouble at a theory not very far removed from the
truth. With the facile, half-contemptuous pity of youth,
they threw a hasty crumb of sympathy to the elder man,
obliged to return to the house where had lived the murdered
lady for whom he had then confessed his admiration.
Still, they wished it had not made him so unpleasant.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>But Artus de Brencourt was to be pitied—and condemned—for
reasons more acute than ‘les jeunes’ had divined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had come back to the Clos-aux-Grives after his escape
from prison not only because, in the position he held, it
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
was his plain duty to do so, but also because even a momentary
return to Mirabel, where all his desire was set,
would most certainly have involved Mme de Trélan in
suspicion, or so he considered. Madly as he craved to see
her again, his love was sufficiently unselfish to shrink from
that. But he had by no means abandoned his intention
of breaking down her opposition to his suit. When he got
back to Finistère, and found that the Abbé had been
despatched to Mirabel in spite of his letter of dissuasion
(which had been prompted in reality less by fear for her
safety than by anxiety about the preservation of her
incognito) he decided that he must wait at the Clos-aux-Grives
till the latter’s return, for, successful or unsuccessful,
the priest would certainly bring some information about
the concierge and the state of affairs at the château. Then
he could make up his mind to his next move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there were tormenting elements in this course. If
the Abbé proved unsuccessful in his quest, it was quite
likely—having regard to the issues for Finistère hanging
on the securing of the gold—that the Marquis himself
would resolve to go after it, and then.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Or again,
suppose that M. Chassin were successful, and that his
very success brought “Mme Vidal” into suspicion?
Prison at least would face her again—possibly deportation.
Or, almost worst of all, suppose the self-contained little
priest, anything but a fool, and deep, as he always suspected,
in de Kersaint’s confidence, should discover who she was.
What was there, indeed, to prevent her telling him? It
was hardly surprising that during these days of suspense
M. de Brencourt developed into a martinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For he had besides to endure the close daily companionship
of the man he hated, envied, pretended to despise,
admired, the man who—so he chose to put it—had deserted
Valentine, the man who nevertheless had had for nineteen
years the rights of a husband and to whom perhaps she
was, in spite of everything, not indifferent. Had she not
all but swooned at the news of his death, though he had so
completely cast her off? That she might conceivably
care for Gaston de Trélan still, that was the horrible doubt
which gnawed at the Comte’s heart—almost more than a
doubt in the hours when he allowed himself to realise how
little foundation he had for the charges which he had
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
made against the Duc. But he fed himself on those
accusations till he had come almost to believe in their
truth. They <span class='it'>must</span> be true—else why had he found Mme
de Trélan under a false name, in an inconceivable situation,
and ignorant whether her husband were alive or dead?
He must have treated her abominably, or she would long
ago have taken steps to join him! And now that, since
his visit to Mirabel, suspicion as to de Kersaint’s identity
existed no longer, for he <span class='it'>knew</span>, the perpetual craving to
wound, to avenge himself—and her—together with the
intoxicating consciousness of the secret which he held, and
which he meant to keep for ever from the one man on
earth who had a right to know it, and to whom it would
mean, as he guessed, at the lowest estimation release from
hell, and perhaps much more—all these were driving him
insensibly to a precipice which now he could see gaping
in front of him and that other man almost with joy, for
even if both of them fell over it he cared little, provided
they fell together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last day or two had lent a more sinister purpose
to his gibes. It began to be clear to him that he could not
even wait for the Abbé’s return, which might take place
any day now. For what if he brought the news of the
presence at Mirabel of something far more wonderful and
precious than what he had gone to search for? All would
be over then; <span class='it'>he</span> would certainly go to her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
prospect was intolerable; the only way to render it
impossible of realisation was to provoke de Kersaint—if
he could—before the priest’s return. And despite the
astonishing armour of self-control which the Marquis
had succeeded in buckling on, the latter was beginning
to lose patience at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte saw it, and hugged the knowledge. Everything
that he could say, short of direct personal insult,
he had said to him whenever he had the chance, during
the last four days. And he knew that his victim, unless
he revealed his identity, was helpless to do more than
resent his insinuations, since they were all directed against
that presumably absent person, the Duc de Trélan. But
the veil was wearing very thin now. The hour would soon
come when the man who had woven it would be forced
to tear it asunder with his own hands.
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span></p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a trying day, sultry, and overshadowed by
the threat of thunder without its relief. A despatch had
come too from a subordinate to say that the zeal of the
recruits in his region was sensibly diminishing because
only one in four could be armed. As usual for the last
three nights, there had been one or two other officers to
supper. M. de Brencourt could smile, now, at that effort
at self-protection on the Marquis’s part. Hatred, like
love, will find out the way. Yet he had not hoped that
he could bring about the explosion that very evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the other officers had withdrawn and the supper
dishes were removed, M. de Kersaint was obliged to consult
his chief of staff about the news which had just arrived.
Nor, to do him justice, did the Comte de Brencourt give
to the matter in hand much less attention than he would
have done had their relations been perfectly normal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end M. de Kersaint remarked that unless the
gold from Mirabel was in their hands soon it would come
too late to be of use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have not heard further from the Abbé then?”
asked his second-in-command, though he was aware that
he had not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may be arrested—the whole attempt a failure then,
for all we know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said de Kersaint with a little sigh. “And with
it the best of our hopes for Finistère.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Brencourt shook his head in an affectation of sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder you can sleep at night, Marquis, with so
much on your mind!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proud grey eyes met his. “I do not find it difficult,
thanks,” returned his leader drily, and he got up and went
to the window, where he pulled aside the rough curtain
and looked out. Moonlight came in when he did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte made a movement as though to go, but he
still lingered, his eyes fixed on the back turned to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It begins to look as if Mirabel had proved as fatal to
the Abbé as to Roland and myself and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. its late
mistress,” he observed.
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must hope not,” replied the Marquis after a moment,
drumming lightly on the window pane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel sure,” went on the Comte, “that, from what I
have heard of him, de Trélan’s remorse over that business—assuming
that he felt any—would be due rather to the
damage suffered by his own reputation than to any affection
for his wife. Don’t you think that is probable, de Kersaint?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man at the window suddenly flung open the casement
as though he needed air. And indeed there was
sweat on his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way,” pursued his tormentor, as though struck
by a sudden idea, “I don’t believe I ever asked you, Marquis,
who was de Trélan’s heir? He had no <span class='it'>legitimate</span>
children, I fancy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a momentary pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said M. de Kersaint, without moving. “The Duc
de Savary-Lancosme, his cousin-german, would have come
into most of his property.” And he shut the window again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Savary-Lancosme alive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was guillotined in ’94.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph. He must sleep more soundly, then, than
his cousin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis de Kersaint dropped the curtain over the
moonlit casement and half turned round. “I really do
not know why he should,” he said shortly, yet speaking,
as was evident, with the most careful self-restraint. “Shall
we say good-night now, Comte?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very little more and he might do it, if he could only
hit on the right thing. So, instead of taking this broad
hint, the Comte de Brencourt sat down carelessly on the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” he observed slowly, and with a sort of
casual reflectiveness, “if <span class='it'>that</span> was the reason of de Trélan’s
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. poltroonery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited, after that last substantive, either for an
explosion, or for a question as to what he meant. Neither
came. But, glancing across the zone of lamplight to the
window, he saw the smitten rigidity of his victim, and was
filled with hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean,” he explained, “the fact of the late Duchesse’s
childlessness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Poor lady!”
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Luck had served him far better than he could ever know.
He had stabbed at the rawest wound of all, the most
torturing memory. The Marquis swung round with
clenched hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who gave you the right to make suppositions
about the private affairs of the Duc and Duchesse de Trélan,
Monsieur?” he demanded in a voice of hardly suppressed
fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte got off the table and looked at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same Fates, I imagine,” he answered coolly,
“which caused the Duchesse to stand, in her lifetime,
so sadly in need of some champion, by making her husband
what he was—what he is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at that the string snapped entirely. M. de Kersaint
strode round the table. “Mort de ma vie! this is insufferable!
Monsieur de Brencourt, I have borne insolence and
innuendo from you long enough! I have been far too
patient——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The innuendo, Monsieur,” broke in de Brencourt
with a grim exultation, “the innuendo, since you term it
so, shall be dropped. God knows I desire nothing better!
Anything that I have said of the Duc de Trélan I will
repeat to the Duc de Trélan’s face. You cannot retort
that that is an idle boast! Have I not recently seen a
certain portrait in primrose satin at Mirabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The original of that portrait put his hand for a second
over his eyes. But it was only for a second; then he faced
his enemy, his head high, and said, with blazing scorn,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is an idle boast, and a cowardly! You have insulted
me past endurance—have gone on doing it—and yet you
know I cannot demand satisfaction. Is that chivalry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cannot demand satisfaction?” cried the Comte de
Brencourt with a sneer. “And why not, pray? Are you
still intent on keeping up the farce of the Duc de Trélan’s
being somewhere far away—somewhere <span class='it'>safe</span>—somewhere
where you have to write letters to him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the farce of
his not being in this very room, standing on the identical
spot you are standing on now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I do not mean that!” retorted M. de Kersaint,
white with fury. “I mean that you have gone on
in your underhand and venomous persecution, knowing
that, placed in such a position as mine, I could not call you
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
to account for it. You have done a despicable thing
knowing that you were safe from consequences, but
some day—some day, by God,—you shall give me full
reparation for your conduct!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte, darkly flushed, was gripping the hilt of his
sword with his left hand. “I will give it you to-night—with
all my heart!” he said between his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not be absurd, Monsieur!” said his leader sharply.
“You are beside yourself to suggest such a thing. How
<span class='it'>could</span> we go out, you and I, the general and the second-in-command
of the army of Finistère! The whole of the
West would ring with the scandal. We must part, that
is plain, but we cannot fight .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unfortunately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte saw the precipice receding. He gathered
himself together for a final effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Monsieur le Duc de Trélan,” he said, “give me
leave to tell you that, my opinion of your past behaviour
being unchanged, I must now add to it what I think of
your present. You have not redeemed yourself by these
last years—by that business of Rivoli and the rest. You
are, as you always were .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>un lâche</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had reached his goal. That intolerable word,
delivered moreover like the sting of a whip, was too much
for the determination of the proud nature at which it was
flung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you fight me now?” asked de Brencourt, watching
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” said Gaston de Trélan with a gasp, and, as
though to seal his reversed decision and make it impossible
to withdraw from it, he struck the Comte with the back of
his hand, but quite lightly, across the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you!” said the latter, apparently accepting
the formal blow in the same spirit. “I thought you would
see reason in the end.” He passed his handkerchief across
his lips and became business-like. “We cannot fight here,
that is plain. And we must dispense with seconds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a full moon,” said the Duc de Trélan curtly.
“We must go to the forest. By that dolmen they call the
Moulin-aux-Fées would serve. There is a level clearing
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that would serve admirably. We must provide
some excuse—say we are anxious to make a reconnaissance
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>
or something of the kind—since I suppose it is impossible
to get out without being seen. Nobody should suspect
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless one of us does not come back. Then it will be—the
work of some lurking Republican.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint nodded. “And the weapons? Swords,
I presume.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should prefer swords,” said his adversary. “Unfortunately”—he
looked doubtfully at his right hand—“I
am afraid that since the affair of la Croix-Fendue my wrist
is still too stiff for anything so delicate as sword-play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had forgotten that. It must be pistols then. We
shall have to go further off, that is all. Who is officer of
the guard to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young La Vergne, I am afraid,” said the Comte.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis consulted his watch. “Shall we say in
half an hour, then?” he suggested. “I have one or two
matters that I must set in order, in case I fall; you doubtless
the same. And if I fall, Comte, the command devolves
naturally on you—at least till you hear from Edinburgh.
Possibly you would be confirmed in the command of Finistère.”
He spoke quite dispassionately, as if he were one
of the seconds in whose hands, had not the circumstances
been unusual, the conduct of the affair would have
rested, and going to the little travelling safe began to
unlock it. De Brencourt picked up some papers he had
brought with him and went to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have only to mark anything you wish ‘Private,’
and I give you my word it shall be burnt unread,” he
observed. “I for my part shall rely on a similar consideration.”
On him, too, rested the same forced composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may do so, Monsieur,” said the Marquis, without
looking round. “There will be nothing private here,
however, but a couple of letters that I am going to write
now. You will find, on the other hand, a number of papers
that will be essential to you if you have to take over the
command. I will just see that they are in order.—Will you
come back for me in half an hour, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the Comte, and, something impelling him
to salute, perhaps for the last time, the leader he hoped to
kill, he did so and went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment that the door closed behind his enemy
Gaston de Trélan drew a long, almost a sobbing breath,
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
and bending his head stood gripping the edge of the safe
with both hands. He had had such a hard fight of it
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he was beaten after all. But the consuming
rage that shook him left no room now for consciousness of
defeat; and that rage, so overpowering for a moment or
two as to make him feel physically faint, gave way in its
turn to a savage gladness. For duty’s sake, and at almost
unbearable cost to himself, he had tried to avoid this thing—but
now that it had come, and he was going to settle the
score, what place was there for anything but a measureless
relief? Good God, because he commanded Finistère,
was he to submit to a series of insults without parallel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a few minutes he loosed his hold of the safe, sat
down at the table, pulled writing-materials towards him,
and began to write rapidly. Thrusting his hand inside
his shirt when he had finished, he brought out and
slipped over his head something which hung round his
neck on a ribbon. It was a white, gold-edged cross with a
red medallion in the centre surrounded by a border of
white and gold—the cross of the Order of Maria Theresa,
never given save for personal valour in the field. Around the
medallion ran the single word, “<span class='it'>Fortitudini</span>.” He placed
the decoration in the letter, which he sealed and addressed
to “Monsieur le Vicomte de Céligny,” writing underneath,
“Not to be opened except in the event of my death.”
This done, he wrote another which he addressed to the
Abbé Chassin, and took them both to put in the safe.
Standing by that receptacle he then sorted through some
papers and locked it up again. Then he took his pistols
from their case, oiled them very carefully, loaded them,
and laid them on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were still five minutes or so before he went out
to use them. He stood looking down at them a little.
Then he went slowly to the fireplace and laid his head
on his folded arms on the mantel. It was bitter to be
driven to this, just when he was on the eve of making his
work in Finistère a success. To-morrow, if he lived,
he might hear that the money from Mirabel was truly his—for
the Cause—but to-night he must expose himself
to the chance of being killed by this man who had been
trying for days to provoke him. Well, God knew he had
done his utmost that he should not succeed—but there
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
was a limit to what could be borne by flesh and blood.
Would not even <span class='it'>she</span> have said so, for whose memory’s
sake he had tried to do something worthy of a man?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But if he fell, what a way to fall—in a quarrel with
his own chief of staff?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it came back upon him like a flood that his enemy
had dared to use her sacred name as a cover for his own
unspeakable insolence, and regret and reluctance were
gone as though they had never been. He would kill de
Brencourt for that! He went back to the table and took
up his pistols.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was time indeed, for as he pushed the first into his
belt there came a tap at the door, and the Comte reappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you ready?” he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis, with a face like flint, nodded and took
up the second pistol. But M. de Brencourt closed the
door behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before we go,” he said, “would it not be as well to
settle the distance and the order of firing? We might
do that as conveniently here as in the forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” agreed his adversary. “The less time we
spend there the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten paces, then?” suggested the other. “Moonlight
is not daylight.” (But, even in the moonlight, it would
surely be impossible to miss at ten paces.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” agreed M. de Kersaint indifferently.
“Across a handkerchief, if you like—only there are no
seconds to hold it for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and that is the other point,” said the Comte de
Brencourt with some eagerness. “Since there is no one
to count for us, or to make any signal, we cannot with the
best will in the world be sure of firing at exactly the same
moment. I suggest, therefore, that we draw lots to determine
who is to fire first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a second’s pause. The Marquis had not
faced this difficulty. But of course some such reliance on
a hazard was inevitable. “That would certainly be
best,” he replied, looking steadily at its proposer. “There
might, too, in that case, be only one shot to attract attention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so. How shall we settle it then?” asked the
Comte, looking round the room.
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it,” said his opponent rather grimly, plunging
a hand into a pocket. “A very simple way, if somewhat
childish. You see this coin?” And he held out on his
open palm a florin of the last issue of Louis XVI. “I will
put my hands behind my back, and when I bring them
closed into sight again you shall guess which of them
contains the florin. If you guess rightly the first shot
shall be yours—if you guess wrongly, mine. Are you
content? Or would you prefer to hold the coin and I will
guess? But I think the odds are just the same either
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am perfectly content that you should hold it,”
replied his foe. So, standing there in the lamplight, the
Marquis de Kersaint, commanding in chief for the King in
Finistère, and in past days, when he bore another name,
a very great gentleman indeed, put his hands behind him
in the way that children have done for centuries, with
not the fate of a game but his own, perhaps, hanging
on the choice. In another moment he brought his closed
fists in front of him again and looked at M. de Brencourt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I choose the left hand,” said the Comte.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint opened his fingers. The silver effigy
lay in his palm. His life was M. de Brencourt’s for the
taking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go, then,” he said, and turned down the lamp.
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span></p>

<h2 id='b3c4'>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>A MOONLIGHT WALK IN THE FOREST</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Thousands of years before, the ancient and forgotten race,
drowned now in the mists of time, which had set up in
those parts the long ranks of menhirs on the lande, had
raised in the forest, over the remains of some dead chieftain,
a great dolmen of granite. The death-chamber
had long ago been rifled of bones and treasure, but it still
stood, no different from what it had been for the last few
hundred years, with ferns growing out of the cracks, and
one of its supports prone, and an aged oak, immeasurably
younger than itself, watching over it. And to this spot
the two men, with passions no less primitive in their hearts,
made their way; for on one side of the Moulin-aux-Fées,
as the peasants called it, there was a little clearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was true that M. de Kersaint had said, when pistols
were named, that they must go further than this. But
when they beheld the clearing, so inviting in the cold light
that flooded it from a moon well over the tree tops, its
suitability to the work they had in hand struck both of
them so strongly that they agreed it was not necessary to
go on. They had already put a considerable distance
between them and the Clos-aux-Grives, and the little
wind that walked the forest to-night had its light feet set
in the opposite direction. They would risk the sound of a
shot carrying back to the farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, under the impassive gaze of the moon, which alone
made their culpable proceedings possible at this hour,
they measured out ten paces, first one of them, then the
other, and set each a bit of dead branch to mark their
respective positions. When this was done to their satisfaction
they found themselves standing at the Comte’s mark
examining their pistols for the last time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not cock mine until you have fired, Monsieur,”
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
announced the Marquis. “If there were to be an accident—such
things have happened—you might think I had
broken our compact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no fear, Monsieur, of an accident of that kind,”
returned de Brencourt, buttoning his coat up to the throat
as he spoke. “However, as you please—But you are
surely going to take off that white scarf of yours?” And
as the Marquis looked down a little doubtfully at the
white scarf of leadership round his waist, his opponent
added hotly, “Good God, man, do you think I am going
to stand up and fire at you unless you do? It would be
murder! And your sword—the hilt catches the moonlight.”
His own lay already at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” agreed the Marquis, and began, almost,
it seemed reluctantly, to detach the scarf. Having unwound
it he paused with it in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a request to make of you, Comte, before I go
to my place,” he said, not altogether in the tone of one
making a request. “The disagreement between us being
a purely personal matter, I should be glad to have your
word that you intend to respect my secret, whatever the
result of our encounter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Brencourt looked at him. It was some satisfaction
to have him begging for terms—no, begging was certainly
not the word for one who spoke like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I promise you that,” he answered. “Whatever
the result of our encounter, I will keep your secret as far
as in me lies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” returned his adversary. And, throwing
the white scarf from him, he turned and walked to his
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Artus de Brencourt waited a second or two, his pistol
by his side. This was the moment he had hoped and
schemed for, and it was sweet. Yet now that it had
come, it suddenly seemed incredible that they two should
be facing each other like this. A few months ago, who
would have predicted it? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No use to think of that
now, nor, since he was a gentleman, with his enemy’s life
in his hands, did he desire to keep that enemy in mortal
suspense longer than was needful. Best be as quick about
the business as possible. He was a notoriously good
shot.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you ready?” he called out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Marquis de Kersaint, standing like a dark statue
in the moonlight, his face merely a pale blur, his arms
folded on his breast, silently nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte de Brencourt drew a deep breath, raised his
pistol, and took a long and steady aim for the statue’s
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet when he had got the barrel on the mark his hand
began to shake. He bit his lip. If only de Kersaint had
his own weapon cocked, were not standing there
defenceless to be shot at by the man who had insulted him.
It took some courage to do that! And he had called him
a coward.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Had it not been an affair of honour it had
felt a little too much like murder for his taste after all.
Yet he intended to kill Valentine’s husband. And the
iron sanction of the code which kept the other there as a
mere target for his bullet kept him there too, determined
to complete his work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But—could he complete it? The Comte had no idea
how deceptive even the most brilliant moonlight can be,
for now, at a short ten paces’ distance, he found to his
mortification that he could not really distinguish the outline
of de Kersaint’s body, though he could see it as a mass.
That scarf would have been useful, yet it did not occur
to him to regret it. Bending all his will anew to the task
he succeeded in steadying his hand, and his forefinger
began to close round the trigger. In another second or
two.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Would the Marquis spin round, as a man sometimes
did when shot through the heart, or would he fall
forward on his face? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Odd that he should think, at
such a moment, of the execution of Charette three years ago
at Nantes, when, as the tale went, the indomitable spirit
that dwelt in the riddled body of the Royalist chief had
held him upright for a moment in death, with six balls in
him. De Kersaint would have but one—sent there by
a comrade. He, Artus de Brencourt, was doing the
Directory’s work for them! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, he was doing Valentine’s!
One vision of her as he had seen her in her homely
dress at Mirabel, one fleeting thought of those years of
neglect before the storm, of the life she had led since, and
those half regrets were swept aside like gnats before a gale.
The baffling moonlight paralysed him no longer. He
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
corrected his aim for the second time, set his teeth, and
pressed the trigger.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The shot went echoing with startling effect in the silver
silence; it seemed to reverberate even from the empty
dolmen. A scuttling of some frightened creature took
place in the undergrowth, and, as the light smoke cleared
away, rising ghostlike towards the moon, the Comte saw
that M. de Kersaint was staggering a little. He took a
step backwards, threw out his left arm and regained his
balance somewhat abruptly, while the uncocked pistol
slid with a rustle and a thud into the bracken at his feet.
Either to recover it, or because he could not help himself,
he sank to one knee and appeared to be groping for it
with his left hand; then, abandoning the attempt, he got
rather unsteadily to his feet again, and stood a moment
with his head bent, and his right arm still across his breast,
where he had kept it all the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are hit, Monsieur? Can you not return my fire?”
called out de Brencourt, still standing ready to receive it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint shook his head, then, turning his back
on him, walked to the nearest tree and stood leaning
against it, always holding his right arm to his breast, but
now supporting it with the other. A doubtless annoyed
owl sailed out of the branches above him with a hoot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, after all, his adversary never even paused to ask
himself whether he were sorry he had not succeeded.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In
a moment he was at his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you hit, Monsieur le Marquis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In my right arm,” said his opponent briefly. “You
have disabled me. I cannot return your fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry for that,” said the Comte rather stiffly.
“Are you sure you cannot—with your left hand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry too,” said the Marquis de Kersaint, lifting
his head. “Believe me, I should not have done you the
poor compliment of firing in the air! But it would be a
farce—my left hand. I am extremely right-handed; so
of what use to risk the noise of another shot. I fancy
my arm is broken. Let us get back.” He did not seem
to know that, even as he spoke, the blood, very dark in the
moonlight, was running through the fingers of the hand
which held his wounded arm pressed up to his body.
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“But first,” interposed the Comte quickly, “we must
stop this bleeding, however roughly. It is not from the
artery, I trust?—no, I think not. Can you take your
coat off .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’d better slit up the sleeve, in any case.
Sit down on this stone, de Kersaint; that will be easier
for both of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, supporting him under his left arm, he guided his
wounded enemy to the fallen block of the dolmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis sat down obediently, and lent his head for
a moment on his left hand. It was evident, though not a
sound passed his lips, that he was in a good deal of pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t do that, Comte!” he said suddenly, as
de Brencourt, kneeling by him in the fern, began to take
out a knife. “One doesn’t want to make more .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. parade
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. about this business than one can avoid. Help me
out of the coat instead.” And he began to unbutton it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much better let me slit the sleeve,” objected de Brencourt
with reason. However, seeing that the Marquis
was determined, he unfastened his swordbelt, and as
carefully as he could, stripped off the long uniform coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you don’t wish to preserve <span class='it'>this</span>?” he remarked,
and, ripping up the drenched shirt-sleeve, examined
the injury. In the outer side of the Marquis de
Kersaint’s forearm, midway between wrist and elbow,
was a small round aperture, from which the blood was
welling in a stream so steady as to suggest that it would
never cease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ball is still there, of course,” observed its sender,
absorbed in his examination. “Otherwise——” He
came to an abrupt pause, suddenly realising by how very
little his messenger of death had fallen short of its goal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Otherwise it would be in my heart, you were going to
say,” finished the Marquis with composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it was stopped by one of the bones,” muttered
de Brencourt, avoiding his eye. “I expect there is a
breakage, as you say.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. However, I had best tie it up
as quickly as possible. I shall need your handkerchief as
well as mine—perhaps your scarf too. It is bleeding like
a fountain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carefully as a surgeon, and with something of a surgeon’s
dispassionate interest, he staunched and bandaged the
injury which he himself had made—no bad exemplar,
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
at that moment, of what there was gallant and chivalrous
in a practice which had little enough to commend it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So there was only one shot after all,” observed M.
de Kersaint presently. “Did you mean to kill me,
Comte?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt, tightening the last knot, looked at
him with an odd expression. “Yes,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so,” returned the Marquis coolly. “I am
afraid, then, that this must have been somewhat of a
disappointment. You take it very well. It was the
moonlight, I suppose? In many ways I should have
been glad of your success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dark flush ran over his opponent’s face. He made no
reply, and laying down the bandaged arm gently on its
possessor’s knee, began to scrub at his own bloody hands
with a frond of bracken. When he had got them comparatively
clean he threw it away, got up from his knees,
took a turn or two and came back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marquis,” he said, rather stiffly, “I aimed as well as
I could. Evidently it was not to be.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And now, if you
will allow me, I should like to take back the term I applied
to you this evening. It is not applicable—and I do not
think that I ever believed it was. But I meant you to
fight me. You can guess why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and we need not go
into what is done with.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And now that we have met,
and blood has flowed—and I sincerely regret, as I said,
that it should be yours alone——” He stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis de Kersaint, still without his coat, got up
from the fallen stone. To him also a duel was sacramental,
and bloodshed, at the risk of life, did serve, between
gentlemen, to wash out enmity. To what degree, however,
that stain was ineffaceable, they could hardly know then,
for they were both moved, little as they showed it, by the
near passage of the dark angel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, M. de Brencourt,” he said quietly. “Allow
me to apologise, in my turn, for the blow I struck you—though
I think you understand why I struck. I am
quite willing to take your hand if you are willing to take
mine; indeed, I was going to propose that, as neither of
us after all is to remain permanently beside the Moulin-aux-Fées,
we had better try, for the King’s sake, to forget,
if we can, what has passed between us. I at least am
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
content to try. I do not wish to change my second-in-command.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I to change my leader!” cried the Comte, really
shaken by the generosity which could forget his deliberate
campaign of insults. He too held out his left hand, and
they sealed the compact. Perhaps at the moment he
almost forgot how much less complete the covenant was
than the other imagined—forgot what he was holding
back and meant to go on holding back.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” he said, recovering himself, “if you insist
on getting into that sleeve again.” He picked up the
redingote. “It is a long way back—at least I fear you will
find it so, de Kersaint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only wish it were longer,” said the Marquis, with a
little frown. “They have such sharp ears, those young
men of mine—I do not think the bone is broken after all.
Help me into my coat, and lend me your arm, and I shall
do very well.”</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The Clos-aux-Grives at last, white in the moonlight,
between the sparser trees of the forest’s verge. It was
high time. But before the duellists were quite near
enough to give the countersign to the sentry, whose
challenge had just rung out, a figure from within the courtyard,
shouting something to him, vaulted the low wall by
the Chouan and raced towards them. So vehement was
its haste that the two gentlemen stopped. It was then
seen that the athlete was the Chevalier de la Vergne, in
such a hurry that he had hardly time to pull himself up and
to salute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw you coming, Monsieur le Marquis,” he exclaimed
breathlessly. “There is great news—M. l’Abbé has come
back! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>What, are you hurt, sir!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“Damnation!” said the Comte de Brencourt under
his breath.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a trifle,” returned the Marquis carelessly. “A
stray Blue in the forest; nothing to worry about.
Come, Comte, let us go and welcome the Abbé. This is
indeed good news—if it means his success.” And, loosing
the Comte’s arm, as much, perhaps, to show his ability
to do so as because the Comte displayed a tendency to be
rooted to the spot, he began to walk towards the entrance.
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, Monsieur le Marquis,” exclaimed the young officer,
accompanying him, “are you sure that it is not much?
Why, I can see the blood on your sleeve .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and on
your breast too! Take my arm, de grâce,—and you will
let me turn out the guard at once, will you not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is unnecessary, my dear boy,” replied his leader;
“so is your support. M. de Brencourt settled the Blue
for me.—Good-night, Sans-Souci,” he said, as the sentry
presented arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you will not find the Blue, La Vergne—he got
away after all,” added the Comte quickly from behind.
To him the duel was a secondary matter now—and, in
itself, the Abbé’s success or failure also. What other
information had the priest brought from Mirabel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
how soon would he divulge it? Would it be possible to
see him before de Trélan did? Hardly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where is M. Chassin?” enquired M. de Kersaint
directly they got inside, when the light from the sconce
on the wall instantly betrayed to Artamène’s distressed
but ever observant eyes how pale he was—and with a
smear of blood on his cheek too. “In my room?—then
I will see him at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me light you up the staircase, Messieurs!” cried
the zealous Artamène, taking down the sconce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are not the stairs lighted as usual?” asked the Comte
irritably. “Yes, of course they are. No, go to your
bed, La Vergne, and don’t harass M. de Kersaint any
more!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget, La Vergne is officer of the guard to-night,”
said the Marquis with a little smile. “Goodnight, my
boy. Don’t bother about that Blue. As for my arm,
the Abbé will do anything further that is necessary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he went off, followed by the Comte. Artamène
looked after them, uttering wicked words below his breath;
then he replaced the sconce, tiptoed into the “nursery,”
and picked his way among the dozen or so slumbering
forms there till he came to Lucien du Boisfossé’s pallet
in a corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucien, wake up!” he whispered, stooping over him
and gently shaking him. “I want to tell you something!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Astoundingly, Lucien opened his eyes at once. “Don’t
blow into my ear like that, officer of the guard!” he
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
returned. “And there’s no need to poke me so. I was
awake. I have not been to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Heavens!” ejaculated Artamène. This was
indeed an evening of surprises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was,” said Lucien, complacently, “composing a
proclamation in rhyme to the <span class='it'>patauds</span> of this canton. It
was to begin——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that,” cut in Artamène ruthlessly. “Two
much more interesting things have happened while you
have been asl——I mean awake. The first is, that M.
l’Abbé has returned from Mirabel——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucien sat up in bed. “<span class='it'>Laus Deo!</span>” he exclaimed.
“And has he got—<span class='it'>it</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wouldn’t tell me,” said the enquirer, “but I think
from his manner that he has not been unsuccessful. However,
the second thing is even more momentous. M. le
Marquis and M. le Comte have just come back from a
moonlight stroll in the direction of the forest, M. le Marquis
as white as a sheet, with blood all over the sleeve of his
coat and his right arm tucked into his breast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” ejaculated Lucien, bounding upon his
couch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chut! don’t wake the others! (It will be impossible
to keep it quiet, though.) It appears that they met a
Blue in the forest—or at any rate a Blue was in the forest,
dropped, perhaps like an acorn from a tree, for I know not
how otherwise he could have been there—and he shot at
and wounded M. le Marquis—one doesn’t yet know how
seriously—and then, apparently, M. de Brencourt settled
the hash of the Blue. At least, he fired and hit him;
though he thinks the fellow got away. Now, what do you
think of that for a Breton night’s entertainment? Don’t
sit on your bed looking like an owl, Monsieur du Boisfossé!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An owl,” replied the young man unperturbed, “is
the emblem of wisdom, also of us Chouans. I am thinking
this, my Artamène, that while lying here engaged in the
labours of composition, I heard, far away—so far away
that I did not think it worth while disturbing the slumbers
of the officer of the guard——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what did you hear?” asked his friend, kicking
him gently in return for this thrust.
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“A shot—one shot,” replied Lucien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Artamène’s mobile face changed, “Of course you will
repeat that I was asleep, which is a lie. But I never heard
it—nor the sentries, I presume, since none of them reported
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear friend,” enquired Lucien earnestly,
“if I was able to hear one shot, why didn’t I hear two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stared at each other in the dim light, these two
young investigators, the one sitting up in his shirt on his
pallet, the other, booted and sword-girt, kneeling beside
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean,” said the latter after a moment, “that if
you heard the shot which this solitary Blue fired at M. le
Marquis, why did you not hear the shot which M. de Brencourt
fired at the Blue?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is my meaning,” responded Lucien weightily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that—provided you were not dreaming—there was
only one shot fired .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that was fired at the Marquis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucien nodded. “Obviously, since he has been hit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that shot could not have fired itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is usual to infer a finger on the trigger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The question is, Whose finger?—No, Lucien, we had
better not go any further! As we have already said, there
has been storm in the atmosphere lately. And this desire
for exercise in the moonlight! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yet it must have been
all en règle, even though there were no witnesses, since
they came back together on good terms—arm in arm,
in fact. But for the Marquis to proceed to such an extremity!—I
never did like M. de Brencourt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are going too fast, mon ami,” remarked the
soberer Lucien. “They would never have chosen pistols,
and risked being heard at headquarters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They seem to have chosen <span class='it'>a</span> pistol, however,” retorted
Artamène. “Whatever has happened, I am convinced that
there has been the devil of a lot of lying done to-night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and that there will be even more to-morrow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charlemagne, I regret to say,” responded his friend,
shaking his head, “—Charlemagne, who recently read me
such a homily on truthfulness!”
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span></p>

<h2 id='b3c5'>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>WHAT THE ABBÉ THOUGHT OF IT</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Up in the Marquis de Kersaint’s room M. Pierre Chassin,
priest and plotter, tired as he was, had been for some time
pacing uneasily up and down. He had just returned from
the mouth of the Seine and the successful despatch to
England of the gold of Mirabel, which (as the agent in
Paris at whose house it had been accumulating had indeed
come under suspicion) the Abbé had had to pack up
with exceeding haste, and take to the coast himself. But
though he had just passed some agitated days and nights
between Paris and Harfleur, the memory of them was as
nothing to that of the shock and emotion he had experienced
in the chapel at Mirabel. So that he was thinking at the
moment scarcely at all of what he had so dexterously got
out of the château, but of what he had left in it. And he was
fairly distracted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the twentieth time he cursed the contre-temps which
had hurried him away from Mirabel in so untimely a
fashion, before he had had opportunity to decide whether
he ought or ought not to break his solemn promise to Gaston—that
promise renewed at Hennebont. Now he saw
clearly that it would have been right to break it, and that
if he had only been granted a little longer there he would
have done so. And had not such grave issues depended
on his getting the money into safety he would willingly
have risked his own personal liberty by remaining a few
hours longer near the Duchesse; he would even have
returned to Mirabel when his errand was accomplished, but
for the practical certainty of being arrested and thereby,
probably, compromising her. Even now the idea had
visited him of writing to her and revealing the Marquis de
Kersaint’s identity. But that would indeed be confiding
his foster-brother’s jealously-guarded secret to the birds
of the air, for he could not use a cipher to Mme de Trélan,
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
and the letter might be intercepted by the Government
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it might some day mean Gaston’s life if the
Directory knew who he really was. Still, she herself might
write to the “Marquis de Kersaint” to make enquiries.
God grant it! Or she might come in person, as he had so
earnestly pressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, if only he had learnt her secret otherwise than
under the seal of the confessional, when the knowledge
might not be communicated, might not be used. If only
he had had the wit to guess it! But we only see what we
have some grounds for believing that we shall see.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Here he was again, possessed of information he could not
impart to the person vitally interested—only in this case
time would never show him that he ought to disclose it.
His lips were shut, absolutely, till eternity. Some other
person must make the revelation—and the only other
person who had the necessary knowledge was the Comte de
Brencourt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And M. de Brencourt had escaped, was already back.
Perhaps he had told Gaston by this time—for what more
natural than that the “kinsman” of the Duc de Trélan
should be immediately informed of a fact of such paramount
importance to his relative? Something, however, made
the priest quite sure that M. de Brencourt had not taken
this course—the remembrance of what he knew to be his
deliberate lie to the Duchesse de Trélan. After viewing
that lie from every side M. Chassin had come to a pretty
correct estimate of the motive that had prompted it, and
it did not raise his hopes of forcing the Comte to a revelation.
Indeed, he almost wondered why M. de Brencourt
had returned to the Clos-aux-Grives at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wondered, too, with a growing uneasiness, on what
conceivable errand the two gentlemen could have gone out
to-night, as, on his own arrival, the exhilarated Artamène
had told him they had done. Why should they both go,
at such an hour, and without the shadow of an escort?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he heard steps and voices in the passage, and stopped
his pacing. They were back. His forebodings suddenly
seemed ridiculous. The door was opened a little way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, de Brencourt. Good-night,” said Gaston’s
voice, with a ring of fatigue in it. “No, thanks; the
Abbé will do anything that is necessary.” And he came in.
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The light in the room, emanating from a somewhat
smoky lamp, did not instantly reveal his state, and he
said, in a quite natural manner, “My dear Pierre! This is
indeed good! And I am to congratulate you, I think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Chassin had advanced round the table to take his
outstretched left hand. Nearer, he saw; and he no
longer took the hand in question—he caught at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston! What in God’s name has happened to you?
Here—sit down, for pity’s sake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled out the nearest chair from the table, and,
far from unwillingly, the wounded man sat down in it,
saying as he did so, “But, my dear Pierre, why all this
emotion at the sight of a little blood?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé suddenly made use of a very unecclesiastical
expression. “What has happened to you?” he repeated,
standing over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you must know,” said his foster-brother, leaning
back with a little smile in the chair, “I have had the bad
luck to be winged by a Blue who must have been lurking
in the forest, and the wound, slight in itself, has bled a good
deal, that is all.—Sit down, Pierre, and tell me your news.
You have succeeded—I can see it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How he could see it on the perturbed countenance
gazing down at him was not easy to guess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have succeeded,” returned the priest shortly.
“But there is plenty of time to talk about that later. I
will see this wound first, if you please. What in the name
of fortune were you doing in the forest at this time of night?
And who bandaged this up—who was the imbecile who
took your coat off you and put it on again instead of
slitting up the sleeve?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the Marquis, submitting to the inevitable, had
stiffly and painfully drawn his arm out of the breast of his
coat and laid it on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One question at a time, mon cher,” he said. “M. de
Brencourt was with me, and it was he who was kind enough
to do what he could for me. I myself was the imbecile
who insisted on getting into my coat again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why, may I ask?” enquired the Abbé, rapidly
unbandaging. “Do you enjoy putting yourself to
pain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does anybody?” retorted his patient. “I did not
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
want to cause more alarm on my return than I needed;
that was why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph; very thoughtful of you!” commented
M. Chassin, glancing at him. “Tch! tch! a nice business!
The ball is still there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe it is,” admitted M. de Kersaint almost apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you move your fingers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can, but I don’t want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder where it has got to,” murmured the Abbé,
still examining. “Does that hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, infernally,” responded the victim, wincing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, I will not do it again. Wherever it is the
bullet will have to come out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally,” said the Marquis resignedly. “But at
least tie my arm up for to-night—and tell me about the
treasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me first about this, Gaston. Was the man near—this
looks to me as if it had been fired from a few yards off
only? Did you see him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no; he was in the shadow under the trees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whereabouts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His foster-brother hesitated. “Not far from the
Moulin-aux-Fées.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Virgin, what were you doing there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps foolishly, taking a walk.” And then he went
on quickly, “But are you not going to tie this thing up,
or am I to spend the night like this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For his bared arm, streaked with blood and much swollen
round the little bluish orifice, rested before him on the
table, and the Abbé had retired into the bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to wash it first,” came his voice from
within. The Marquis put his head back against the chair.
He suddenly looked exhausted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of pouring water was heard. “This solitary
Republican had a musket, I imagine—or was it a pistol?
The wound looks to me rather like a pistol-wound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it was a musket .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at least I suppose so,” replied
the duellist almost inaudibly. The priest came to the
door of the bedroom and looked at him for a second; then
he vanished again and reappeared with a glass in his
hand.
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drink this, if you please, Gaston!” he said authoritatively.
His brother opened his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I detest brandy,” he said, almost petulantly. “And
you surely do not think that I am going to faint?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is as it may be,” returned the Abbé, watching the
speaker narrowly as he took and drained the glass. And
he washed and bandaged very speedily, asking not a single
further question during the operation. Perhaps he had
come to the conclusion that he were better advised not to
do so, for other reasons than that his patient was not in the
most fitting condition to answer them. After which, refusing
in his own turn to satisfy any enquiries about the
treasure that evening, he announced his intention of
acting as the Marquis’s body-servant for the nonce; and
did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll do best with this pillow under your arm,” he
observed when the wounded man was in bed. “We will
have the surgeon from Lanvennec as early as we can get
him to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damnable nuisance, that!” muttered the sufferer
impatiently. “Are you sure that you could not manage
to extract the ball yourself, Pierre?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having some small idea of the intricate structure even
of the human arm,” responded M. Chassin, arranging the
pillow under the arm in question, “I am quite sure that
I could not, without possibly maiming you for life. And
why should you object to having a surgeon?—Is that
comfortable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since you succeeded in extracting the gold from
Mirabel,” observed Mirabel’s owner, looking up at him
with a rather feverish brilliance in his eyes, “I should have
thought that a trifle like this would be nothing to you.
My God, Pierre, have you really got it all—twenty-five
thousand pistoles? It is almost too good to believe!
Why, with half that amount——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest held up his finger, smiling. “Yes, I got it
nearly all away. And now you must——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A moment, Pierre! no, I insist on asking this! That
woman at Mirabel—the concierge; I hope she has not
been compromised in any way? I should be most deeply
concerned if it were so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, the concierge,” repeated M. Chassin, and he
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
paused. “—No, as far as I know, she has not fallen
under suspicion at all. But I had to leave extremely
hurriedly, so that I should be very glad if I—if you, rather,
could make enquiries on the point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall do so,” said his foster-brother. “Think of
what I owe her—the boy’s safety, perhaps his life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Why are you looking at me like that, Pierre?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest pulled himself together. “You have asked
enough questions for to-night, Gaston. Just answer me
one in return.—Since we parted, has not M. de Brencourt
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. guessed your secret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis flushed, and his mouth tightened. “I
think he guessed it long ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he knows it now, beyond guessing—you know
that he knows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pause. “Yes,” said the Duc de Trélan at last, frowning
and reluctant. “I know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that he knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his head away on the pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” responded M. Chassin rather grimly.
And then, he added, in a tone astonishingly light-hearted,
“I daresay it is as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duc bit his lip. “I am glad you think so,” he
replied in an exceedingly cold voice. And from the reply
and its manner the priest learnt what he wanted to learn.
M. de Brencourt had made no pleasant use of his knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you need anything in the night, or cannot sleep,
Gaston, call for me. I shall spend it in your room out
there.—Yes, it is necessary. Try not to make calculations
about what Mirabel has given you, but get some rest if you
can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I cannot, what pleasanter subject could I have
to think about?” enquired his patient, looking up at him
again. The frown was gone. “And for that, as for so
much else, I have to thank you, my brother.” He held out
his left hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And suppose,” said the Abbé in a low voice, as he took
it in both his own, “suppose that I had come back with my
news to find you with a bullet in your heart! Gaston, you
might have remembered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hand in his own returned his grip, but the voice said,
with fair composure, “Yes, it was foolhardy, that walk.
But surely, Pierre, you know that one day or the other
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
you are certain to find me as you say; and you know, too,
that if I have finished my task it is what I should desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Pierre Chassin very gravely. “I do not
wish you any better death, when the time comes. But the
death you faced to-night was not worthy of you. Perhaps
the prayers of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of one who lived at Mirabel averted
it. And I know you must have been tried beyond
endurance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. See, I have shaded the candle so; and
remember to call me. Good-night, mon frère.”
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span></p>

<h2 id='b3c6'>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><span class='it'>MEMINI ET PERMANEO</span></h3>

<p class='noindent'>It was soon plain to Gaston de Trélan that, between bodily
pain and mental turmoil, sleep was not likely to visit him
much that night. He would, at least, keep that fact
from Pierre if he could.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Poor Pierre! it seemed to be
his fate to cause him anxiety! And he owed him so much,
more than a man could ever repay: his life—that was
little—but what measure of self-respect he had also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That life he had nearly cast away this evening, and,
because of his present position and circumstances, he fully
shared the priest’s reprobation of the hazard, but no other
course had been possible, for not Pierre himself, who had so
quickly penetrated the tale of the “Blue,” could guess the
lengths to which he had suffered de Brencourt to go
before he consented to fight him. Even to Pierre he was
not going to repeat the things the Comte had said.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seven years ago, in London, only the little priest’s affection
and determination had prevented society from saying
next day, “You remember that French émigré, the Duc de
Trélan, whom we used to meet everywhere? Well, he
has just shot himself—and small wonder!” And it was
not as if Gaston and his protégé were then on terms of
intimacy, for they had seen little of each other for the
previous ten years or so, since his own visits to St. Chamans
had become so much rarer—above all since the priest
had come under his displeasure for something he had
ventured to say to him down there not unconnected with
Mme de Céligny. Few people, even of his own rank, under
M. de Trélan’s displeasure cared to have dealings with him
in that condition, and yet this peasant-priest, who had
never approached his patron in his own need (for the Duc
afterwards discovered that he had been living in London
for weeks on the verge of starvation) had the disinterested
courage to oppose him in the blackest hour of his life. And
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>
Pierre Chassin had done more than stay his finger on the
trigger, for when, during that dreadful vigil, Gaston himself
had said, out of his agony, that no other path remained
open to him, since neither in England nor in France could
he ever look an acquaintance in the face again, it was the
Abbé who replied, “Then change your name. Do not go
to serve with Condé, as you were intending; go where no
one knows you.” And so, as the Marquis de Kersaint,
the Duc de Trélan—a soldier by education and the descendant
of soldiers—entered Austrian service against the
French Republic, thinking, mistakenly, that he could soon
throw away his life on the battlefield; as the Marquis de
Kersaint he rose to command, found a certain anodyne in
hard work and fighting, and was in touch by letter during
those years with the only man he could really call friend—his
only confidant at least—the humbly-born foster-brother
who had stood by him in his extremity; and had earned the
right to address him more freely than a brother by blood
would ever have dared to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of the two things he sought—forgetfulness or death—M.
de Trélan had found neither. For him the arrogant
motto of his race was only too true—<span class='it'>‘Memini et permaneo</span>,
I remember and I remain.’ It soon became clear to him
that when a man desired extinction he could not have it.
What of the hazards of that Italian campaign, of the
fights for Mantua, of Castiglione, Caldiero, Arcola, through
which he had always come untouched till the day of
Rivoli? Even then death had tossed him aside in the
end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, that disastrous fourteenth of January, 1797,
when the young, haggard-eyed general from Corsica had
beaten the Austrian marshal on that plateau among the
mountains, had brought Gaston de Trélan not death but
honour. At Vienna, when he had recovered from his all
but fatal wound, the Emperor’s hand had bestowed on him
the coveted Cross he wore. So, when the peace of Campoformio
had ended Austria’s wars for a time, and the Abbé
Chassin, now an accredited agent of the Royalists of the
West, had deterred him from entering Russian service and
persuaded him, despite his hatred of the place, to come
to London, he came, in his borrowed name—and found
himself, to his surprise, no little of a hero there also.
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
For there had been attached to Alvintzy’s staff at Rivoli
an English officer of discernment, who, greatly struck by
the part played in the battle by “Colonel de Kersaint”
and his practically forlorn hope of a column, while much
criticising the higher command for devoting it to destruction,
had not spared in his despatches eulogies of its leader nor
regrets for his supposed fate. And after a little while
spent in London, in very different circles from those in
which he moved before, the “Marquis de Kersaint” was
offered by the Comte d’Artois and his council the post of
organising and leading Finistère. He accepted; but
nothing would induce him to go to Edinburgh for the
personal interview which the Prince desired. They had
met too often at Versailles for that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he had now in his hands the chance to do something
that she whom he had lost would have approved. In those
years of self-imposed expiation he had learnt what he had
thrown away, not so much in failing her at the moment
of peril, which he had done in ignorance, but through his
insane blindness in having so little prized, through all the
best of life, a love and a nobility which many a man would
have given his soul to possess. In the great and terrible
awakening through which he had passed in London he had
seen himself as he must have appeared to other men, and
that hell was too sharp at first for any consolation to
visit him, and any least thought or memory of Valentine
could only be more exquisite torture. Yet there came a
day when, instead of averting his mind from what he could
not bear to contemplate, he found himself gazing at it
as the one hope in the blackness, as a trembling pagan
might see the image of the martyr smile upon him, the
martyr his own hands had done to death. Valentine had
loved him; what if she loved him still?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It grew in him to conviction, that first dim fancy; it
saved him, probably, from madness. Lost, sometimes,
like a star which the clouds have blotted out, it always
reappeared, and shone at last with almost the light of an
inspiration, a proof of the strong and steady influence
which the dead can wield. So it came about in the end
that, for all the suffering and hopeless regret involved,
Gaston, Duc de Trélan, was fast in love with his wife’s
memory—so fast that he who had once been “Saint-Charmart”
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
in Paris salons had in Vienna the character of a
woman-hater—so fast that he felt, if Valentine knew the
depth of his repentance and his pain, she, with her wide
charity, would forgive him everything .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as he doubted
not that, in the supreme hour, she had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to forgive oneself, that was a different matter. His
own stark pride, so interwoven with the fabric of his whole
nature, seemed to put that possibility ever further and
further from him as the years went by. Yet, if he could
not himself forget, it seemed at least that others had done
so—till that night at Hennebont when the calumny which
he had believed dead had reared its head for an instant.
Afterwards it had slept again, apparently, through all
the directions he had been obliged to give de Brencourt
about Mirabel before despatching him thither, in which he
knew quite well that he was risking having the veil torn
from the wound. His sacrifice, made to get the gold
for the cause to which he had vowed himself, had recoiled
on his own head. For days now he had been at the mercy
of the Comte, with his knowledge of that slander which was
half true; and de Brencourt had behaved like a Red Indian
with an enemy at the stake, subjecting him to a deliberate
mental torture to which this night’s hazard and bloodshed
had been nothing but a relief. It was small consolation
to know that he, for his part,—till the coming of the
breaking-point—had endured reiterated agony without
giving a sign .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. agony not only to his pride but to his
love. For it was true—by what diabolical instinct had
de Brencourt known it?—that his chief thought when he
received the terrible news had been for his own honour
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though it had long ceased to be true. But that final
remark about the want of an heir, the very taunt he had
thrown at her himself! Even now, alone and in half
darkness though he was, the Duc de Trélan threw his arm
over his eyes and groaned aloud. Ah, that look of mortal
pain on her face when he had spoken those cruel words—the
last he was ever to say to her, the last look he was to
carry away. <span class='it'>Memini et permaneo!</span> And had <span class='it'>she</span> remembered,
when in the same room she had faced that scene of
violence which was but the prelude to the other, the final,
the unspeakable, outside the prison door?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was more than clear to him now what had reawakened
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
de Brencourt’s enmity; it was that visit to Mirabel where she
had lived. That he himself in the past had known nothing
of his wife’s acquaintance with the Comte was but natural,
seeing how their lives, even before their final separation,
had drifted asunder, and it was the fact that de Brencourt
should have constituted himself her defender against him,
her husband, which had proved so intolerable. His wife’s
memory championed against him by a casual admirer!
For the vulgar question as to what Valentine’s relations
with the Comte de Brencourt might possibly have been
had no power over him. It needed not the enshrinement of
death to set her reputation above any suspicion of unfaithfulness.
It had stood there in life, something of a
marvel among so many which were otherwise. He had not
that, at least, to rack him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, judging de Brencourt by the standard common
to gentlemen, since they had been out together and blood
had flowed, he expected a surcease of this bitter hostility.
Absurd as it might be, the fact that he, the injured
party, had a bullet in his arm signified, by the code, that
his honour was satisfied. Since Gaston de Trélan had been
reared in that code, it did not seem absurd to him—though
damnably inconvenient and painful. Yet, though de Brencourt
had shared with him that sacrament of expiation,
and had taken his hand after it, his superior was beginning
to see that he, at least, had undertaken by the dolmen
more than he could carry out. De Brencourt’s conduct
had been too deliberate. They would not be able to work
together to any profit. He would be obliged, after all, to
ask him to resign. For a few days, however, in order to
disarm suspicions on the part of his staff, they would have
to go on as before. Then he would appoint du Ménars in
the Comte’s place. It would be best; for now he must
concentrate all his energies on distributing the arms which
the treasure would shortly procure from England, where,
as already arranged, the Government would buy the gold as
it stood, by weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, at last he had the means in his power to make his
difficult task a success. He would, moreover, have had
the satisfaction of having provided these himself. It meant
a great deal to him—more than he had once thought anything
in life could mean. And lying there, more than a
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
little feverish, he began to be busy with plans and schemes.
Undoubtedly, when the time was fully ripe, as it nearly was,
this great uprising of the West would be no petty insurrection.
It might change the destinies of France. And he
would have no small part in that consummation—he who
had wasted all his opportunities, as Valentine had told him
at the last, and only too truly. Yet he could not lay any
achievement, past or future, any expiation, before her now.
She was gone where she could hear neither of Italy nor
Finistère.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston de Trélan turned restlessly in the bed. His
arm was on fire; he was already between sleep and fever,
and, as sometimes happened still, the desperate wound he
had taken in his side two and a half years ago, though fully
healed, awoke to pain once more. And perhaps because
of the ache of the one and the fever of the other, he suddenly
saw, as a detached spectator might see in a great
picture, the heights and vineyards of Rivoli, the lofty
plateau which the French had so victoriously retained,
the snowy slopes of Monte Baldo above it, below, the zigzag
path from the valley choked with a horrible débris of the
slain men and horses and the cannon of Reuss’s pounded
column—and under Monte Baldo, himself, among the
dead and dying of his own corps, sacrificed in an impossible
enterprise, lying as he had fallen in beating off the charge of
Junot’s cavalry, the whole side of his white Austrian uniform
one great stain of blood. He saw the picture in this curious
way for a moment, with the sun going down red behind the
mountains of Garda—the next, physical memory caught
him up, and he was back in that still conscious body of his,
lying there hour after hour in the cold, defeated and forgotten.
The stars came out in the January night; down
below in the gorge roared the Adige, swollen with the
winter rains; he could hear from the smirched and trampled
snow a few groans, a prayer or two; he was not sure that
he was not groaning himself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And he remembered the
three days of that toilsome march round Monte Baldo on
which he had been despatched in order to take Joubert in
the rear—a project ill-conceived and ill-timed, as he was
well aware—his breaking in consequence with his five
battalions on the doubly-reinforced foe when the battle was
already lost, the hopeless conflict against the whole weight
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
of the French army, with its inevitable close—surrender.
But <span class='it'>he</span> had not surrendered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The cold grew numbing;
was this sleep, or death .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finistère’s leader came out of this half coma of reminiscence
with a start, and realised where he was, how far
removed in time and space from the great Austrian disaster.
He supposed that he was a trifle light-headed, for he had
really felt that the next thing would be the arrival of those
dim, frosty-breathed forms with lanterns, and Schnitterl’s
voice, and he would be lifted to a stretcher and to a resumption
of that life he thought he had done with at last.
Josef had often told him how he had begged to be left there.
But no .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>Et permaneo</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, he thought now, staring at the moving reflection
of the candle on the ceiling, perhaps it was as well that
he had not died there in the snow. There was a chance
to-day of something better than mere personal heroism.
Although nothing, nothing could undo the past nor give
him back the dead, yet, if ever they met beyond the grave,
he might have some guerdon to lay there at her feet—some
tiny sprig of laurel that he could point to and say, “Valentine,
I was not wholly what you thought me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And for a moment he fancied that he saw her, shadowy
and bejewelled, by the bed.
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span></p>

<h2 id='b3c7'>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE CHURCH MILITANT</h3>

<p class='noindent'>It was Lucien who rode to Lanvennec next morning for
the surgeon. M. de Brencourt considered him discreet,
and chose him rather than Artamène (who had besides
been up all night) or any other of the younger men. But
had he known that Lucien, though outwardly respectful
and certainly of a fundamental prudence, was finishing
in his head as he rode a short but very venomous epistle
in verse, beginning, “<span class='it'>Artus, le Judas de nos jours!</span>” in
which, somewhere near the end, “<span class='it'>maître</span>” rhymed with
“<span class='it'>traître</span>,” he might have selected another messenger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the surgeon came, concerned but unsuspicious,
and, assisted by M. Chassin, did his unpleasant work with
reasonable speed and deftness, producing at the end of it
what he vaguely termed a “projectile” from a region of
M. de Kersaint’s forearm which, on the contrary, he described
with much exactitude. And while he was binding
up the arm in question the Abbé quietly annexed the
bullet—“as a souvenir,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But someone else seemed to be souvenir-hunting that
morning. Not long after the Abbé had left his patient
to repose and had established himself again in the outer
room with his reflections and his breviary, the Comte de
Brencourt appeared there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it out satisfactorily?” he enquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite,” replied the priest. “A painful business;
but nothing, mercifully, appears to be permanently injured.
Yet the surgeon tells me that our leader”—he stressed the
words a little—“came very near never having the use of
his sword-arm again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte looked grave. To do him justice, he had
desired last night to kill, not to maim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The curious thing,” went on the priest, “is that the
bullet is a pistol bullet, though last night M. de Kersaint
distinctly said that his assailant shot him with a musket.”
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no! The man had a pistol,” said M. de Brencourt.
“The Marquis was mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Obviously the man had a pistol,” agreed M. Chassin
with serenity. “And not an army pistol either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte met his look. “I should rather like to see
that bullet,” he observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt,” thought the Abbé, twiddling it in his
pocket. “But you are not going to.” And as he made no
audible reply to this suggestion the enquirer had to let the
subject drop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To turn to another question, Abbé,” he said, sitting
down, “one has not yet had opportunity to congratulate
you on your wonderful success. Allow me to do so now—most
heartily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are generous, Monsieur le Comte,” said the priest,
reaching round to place his breviary on the table, and not
seeming to notice the proffered hand. “I thank you all
the more. Another person ought by rights, however, to be
included in your congratulations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who—not Roland de Céligny, surely?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. His friend the concierge—your friend the
concierge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you call her my friend?” asked the Comte
with a frown. “She was certainly de Céligny’s, but in no
sense mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? Well, my friend the concierge, then,” said the
priest with a little smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Brencourt’s heart was beating to suffocation as he
looked at him. Now, surely, he should learn whether to
M. Chassin she were more than a concierge—the main
purpose with which he had sought this interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she was of the greatest service to me,” resumed the
priest, “although, indeed, she gave me no active assistance.
Poor woman, she had had a sad history.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she tell it to you?” demanded the Comte quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, one did not need to be <span class='it'>told</span> it,” replied the Abbé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the look of relief which at that most palpably
appeared on the Comte’s features had the briefest stay there
conceivable, for the aumônier went on to say meditatively,
“I am glad to think that I was able to make her some
recompense. You remember the ruby necklace mentioned
in the plan, Monsieur le Comte?”
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not going to say that you gave her that!”
exclaimed his companion, starting up in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I see you think it an excessive reward?” commented
the Abbé, looking at him enquiringly. “So did
M. le Marquis, I fancy, when I told him. But come now,
Monsieur le Comte, do you not think that it really was no
more than her due, that if ever woman had a right to it,
she had .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that if M. de Kersaint knew all he would
say the same?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Comte was quite speechless. The piercing little
eyes held his, and he could feel them boring into his very
soul. “If ever woman had a right to it” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “if M. de
Kersaint knew all.” The Abbé knew—he knew! He
would never have given her the necklace else. Had he told
the Duc yet?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” went on the priest in a lowered tone,
lowering that uncomfortable gaze also till it rested on his
blunt fingers outspread on his knees, “had there been a
Duchess of the house living I should not have felt justified
in giving so valuable an heirloom to a concierge. But,
under the sad circumstances, I hold that I was absolved,
do not you, Monsieur le Comte?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, curse his maddening and mysterious persistence!
Was he playing with him, or was he ignorant after
all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not for me to say,” muttered the Comte thickly.
“The matter concerns M. de Kersaint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true. Everything about Mme Vidal more nearly
concerns M. de Kersaint than anybody else.” He seemed
to wait for the Comte to agree or else to ask why, but the
Comte could bring out neither assent nor query.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since he is most interested in the treasure,” finished
the Abbé with an amicable air of explaining his statement.
“And, speaking of that treasure, Monsieur le Comte, I
feel sure that by now you have penetrated the disguise.
The cloak was bound to sit rather awkwardly after—you
know what I mean.” He looked at him again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt changed colour. “Disguise? Whose
disguise? No, I do <span class='it'>not</span> know what you mean!” There
was sharp alarm in his tone; whither was this tending?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose disguise?” repeated the priest. “Why, surely,
there is only one disguise in question?” He waited a
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
second and then went on, “The Marquis has perhaps told
you himself who he is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he has not!” returned M. de Brencourt angrily.
“And I do not wish to learn any secrets, if you please,
Abbé!” For if he could carry it off with the Abbé and the
outside world in general that he had never known who de
Kersaint really was, how could he be blamed for not having
told him that his wife was alive?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well said, Monsieur le Comte,” remarked M.
Chassin in a tone of commendation. “And if I were not
sure that, like myself, you know already, I would not
speak to you of the identity of M. de Kersaint and the
Duc de Trélan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But for Heaven’s sake do <span class='it'>not</span> speak to me of their
identity!” cried the Comte, his head reeling as he saw
this knowledge being openly thrust upon him. “How do
I know—or care—who he is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid I have done it now,” said the priest placidly
“but only because I was sure you had guessed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could you be sure?” growled the other. “Did—surely
he did not tell you? Only last night he asked me
to respect his confidence!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said the priest. “After you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. saved his
life, no doubt! Well, Monsieur de Brencourt, you can still
respect it. And since you do know it—<span class='it'>I thought you did</span>—I
am sure that as a gentleman you must regret the expressions
you used, in ignorance, of M. de Trélan, that night at
Hennebont. But you have no doubt made that all right
with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” said M. de Brencourt, with hostility, “is a
matter which concerns M. de Trélan and myself, not you,
Monsieur Chassin.—And as regards confidences, it seems
to me that you were going very near betraying one yourself
just now. If I had <span class='it'>not</span> known .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are you usually
in the habit of doing that?” For now there was a fresh
track of alarm; had the priest betrayed this particular
confidence to one at Mirabel—told the concierge, even
without knowing who she was, that he really came from
Mirabel’s master? It was not impossible. He waited in
acute tension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the Abbé composedly, “without wishing to
belaud myself, it is a point I am rather particular upon.
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
But I assured the Marquis—the Duc—some time ago that
he would have to tell you sooner or later. I wonder he
did not do so before you went to Mirabel. Did you not
guess it then, from the knowledge he displayed of the
place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur l’Abbé,” replied the Comte, with more
than irritation, “it does not seem to me to matter much
what I guessed or what I did not guess. Enough that
I did not impart my speculations to any living soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am sure you were very careful not to do that!”
said the Abbé warmly, and he looked at him harder than
ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt got up and went to the window. He
must know, this man. And yet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did he? He would
have told de Trélan at once, if he did; a bullet in the arm
would not have prevented the reception of that news.
The Comte would almost have given his soul to make sure,
but it was so difficult to plumb the extent of the priest’s
knowledge without exposing his own. A sort of fascination
caused him to recur to the subject of Mirabel, but he
approached it this time from a safer side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When am I to have an account of your securing of the
treasure, Abbé?” he asked, throwing himself down on the
window-seat. “It <span class='it'>was</span> under the hearth in the sallette,
I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And presumably his fellow-adventurer felt he owed him
this, for he gave him, on this invitation, a fairly circumstantial
account of his success at Mirabel and his peregrinations
afterwards. The Comte listened from the
window with the closest attention. After all, <span class='it'>she</span> did not
seem to have played so much part in the business as he
had feared. Perhaps——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I was glad to leave Mirabel in any case,” finished
the narrator with a sigh. “It has a tragic atmosphere—a
haunted feeling. Were you not conscious of that,
Monsieur le Comte?” And as the Comte, for fear of giving
an opening, did not reply, the priest went on, “If it were
M. de Trélan’s once more and he were free to go there, I
am sure he never would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt could not resist the bait. “No, I
should think not!” he broke out in spite of himself. “He
would think always of that night—of his wife, alone——”
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest looked up. “Ah yes, I have heard you in
that vein before, Monsieur le Comte,” he interrupted coolly.
“Now tell me candidly, for I want to know, since I am not
gently born, and can’t understand the refinements of
you nobles—is it not a fact that all the aristocrats who
emigrated early, as M. de Trélan did, emigrated on a point
of honour .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. mistaken, it may be, but still a principle?
Why, if it comes to that, Monsieur de Brencourt, you are,
I think, an émigré yourself, and I don’t suppose you considered
that you were running away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that is true,” conceded the Comte somewhat reluctantly.
“It was—before it became a matter of safety—a
matter of principle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the Duc emigrated in 1790 it would have taken
a very far-sighted person to prophesy the extremities to
which the Revolution would go later on. I happen to
know, too, that he made a great effort to induce the
Duchesse to accompany him. She refused, as it were
on a point of honour also. She disapproved of the
emigration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And dearly enough she paid for that disapproval,”
muttered the Comte.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite true. And don’t you think that M. de Trélan
has paid dearly for it too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pause. “He deserved to,” said his companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé made a gesture. “One must make allowances
for you, Monsieur. I know that you had the honour of
the acquaintance of that noble and unfortunate lady—you
told us so—and it has biased you against a man who
has been equally unfortunate, and who, for seven years,
in the midst of hardships and dangers of his own seeking,
has never ceased to suffer the pangs of a remorse which,
as I hope for salvation, I consider excessive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are an eloquent defender, Abbé,” said the Comte
de Brencourt, shrugging his shoulders. “You should be
at the bar .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I happen to differ from you. I consider,
to put it bluntly, that M. le Duc de Trélan deserves every
sting of remorse he has suffered and may still suffer henceforward.
I am not for letting a man off so cheaply.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Chassin leant forward. “That was a figure of speech,
I presume?” he put in like lightning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” asked the Comte, startled.
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“You spoke of letting him off—as if you had the power
to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte recovered himself. “Do not be absurd,
Abbé!” he said scornfully. “Am I the Judge of all the
earth? Of course it was a figure of speech! How could <span class='it'>I</span>
absolve him for what is done and can never be undone?
Put his behaviour down, at the best, to mistaken judgment,
we have to suffer for our mistakes just as much as for our
crimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé sat back in his chair again. “Since you know
that so well, Monsieur de Brencourt,” he said gravely, “it
might occur to you that it is a mistake—a dangerous
mistake—to play with other people’s remorse. You
might conceivably know that torment yourself one day!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take the risk of that,” said the Comte drily, and
got up. “Especially as I have no idea what you mean
about ‘playing’ with other people’s,” he added, not at all
certain what that phrase did mean in the mouth that had
uttered it. It was time, at any rate, to end this dangerous
interview, which had not told him what he wanted to know.
One thing was clear, that if the priest knew Mme Vidal’s
secret he would eventually tell the “Marquis de Kersaint,”
and after that, no doubt, would come the deluge, and
either he, Artus de Brencourt, or his late adversary would
really be swept away in it, this time. But if there came
no deluge, then M. Chassin did not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will excuse me, mon père,” he said, looking down
at him, “I must quit this interesting conversation for my
duties. Ask M. de .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Kersaint when you go in to him
again, to send for me if he wants me.” And he left the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the Abbé Chassin knew that he did not mean ever
to tell Gaston de Trélan that his wife was alive, that he
meant to go on withholding the knowledge for his own
purpose. And his heart was hardened against M. de
Brencourt.
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span></p>

<h2 id='b3c8'>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE PAWN RETURNS TO THE BOARD</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Roland had come. He stood in the ‘nursery’ with an
overjoyed friend holding him firmly by either arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why,” he was now demanding feverishly, “why
cannot I see M. le Marquis at once, and get it over?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For if his sincere penitence had caused his grandfather
to dismiss him in the end with a sort of blessing—a remark
that he was, if crazy and disobedient, at least no milksop—the
youth knew that there was a still more merited penance
to be gone through before he could expect a blessing <span class='it'>here</span>.
Part indeed of that penance, and perhaps the worst part, he
had already been undergoing at Kerlidec—the ashamed
realisation of the damage his own wilfulness had caused to
his hero’s reputation, in the eyes, too, of one who was
always so inexplicably hostile to M. de Kersaint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” echoed Artamène. “Because, four nights
ago, our revered leader met with an accident in the forest.
(Roland gave an exclamation.) The accident took the
form of a Blue, who shot him in the arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he’s all right,” interpolated the kindhearted Lucien.
“They took out the bullet next morning. The Abbé is
very strict, however.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And M. de Brencourt shot the Blue,” continued
Artamène, “shot him so dead that he was, apparently,
blown completely off this planet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget,” Lucien reminded him, “that the Comte
distinctly stated that he got away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, after he was dead?” asked Roland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They looked at him; they drew closer, very close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bend your head, my paladin,” commanded Artamène.
And, almost glueing his lips to the attentive ear, he
whispered into it, “The question is, whether he ever lived,
that Blue!”
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” exclaimed the Vicomte de Céligny, drawing
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, and likewise Ah, and many other vocables!”
agreed M. de la Vergne, his eyes bright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that means.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucien put a finger on his lip. “We don’t discuss it,
Roland. We don’t—ahem—allow our minds to dwell on
it. But——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Au clair de la lune,’ ” hummed the Chevalier de la
Vergne under his breath. “Two gentlemen, seized with
a sudden desire for a walk at half past ten at night. I
was on duty that evening, and let them out. Also, I met
them returning—in perfect amity, I must confess; most
correct. You see, M. le Comte had been so obliging as to
bandage the wound which he——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t go on, Artamène!” cried Lucien warningly.
“Remember that we are here in the region of hypothesis
only.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to our student. ‘The wound which he so
signally avenged,’ was what I was going to say, mon
cher. Now, is that statement in the region of hypothesis
or of fact? If we knew that, we should know all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, merciful Heavens, why should they——” began
Roland, in tones of horrified amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My good Roland,” replied Artamène, “though most
things are in time revealed to enquiring intelligences,
such as M. du Boisfossé’s and mine, the reason for that
promenade under the goddess of the night has not yet
been disclosed. The infernally bad temper in which M. de
Bren—— Chut! here’s the Abbé, come to summon you
to the scaffold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that was not exactly M. Chassin’s errand. He had
come to say that M. de Kersaint desired Roland to sup
with them and to relate his adventures. And if the prodigal
should have a little private interview with him afterwards
he, the priest, did not fancy that it would be very
terrible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect you have been informed of his mishap,” concluded
M. Chassin, glancing at the other young men, neither
of whom, by a singular coincidence, met his eye. “Thank
God it was not worse.—Now mind you tell him, my child,
all about Mirabel—especially about the concierge there.”
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span></p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>So Roland supped with the gods, as Artamène and Lucien
had put it. The invitation, with its suggestion of pardon
for the past, had pleased and flattered him; the banquet
itself he found at first a little embarrassing. To begin
with, he had uneasy anticipations of the interview afterwards;
and then he found the sight of the Marquis with his
arm in a sling oddly shocking, after the revelations made
to him downstairs. That support was as inconspicuous
as possible, being of black silk; still, there was the leader
of Finistère, at the head of the table, unable to use his
right hand; and at the other end sat the man who was
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. responsible for his condition. The
priest was placed opposite Roland, and Josef Schnitterl,
M. de Kersaint’s bodyservant, waited upon them all;
but he was little in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now if Roland, who possessed only conjectures, felt
embarrassed, the little aumônier, dowered though he was
with an appearance of placidity and a good appetite, had
arrived at the point where he could scarcely bear to see
M. de Brencourt in the same room with his foster-brother—much
less because of what had passed at the Moulin-aux-Fées
than because of the deadly wrong the Comte was doing
him now. And, as a matter of fact the Marquis and his
chief of staff did not seem to be seeking each other’s society
these last few days, though when they were together their
relations were of such a successful correctness that speculation
downstairs—except with MM. du Boisfossé and de la
Vergne—was beginning to languish. No one could have
guessed that the priest was thinking, as he looked at the
handsome and engaging young face opposite him, “If only
Roland knew of her identity!” and that he was preoccupied
every hour of the day with the question, “Will she come?”
or was on tenterhooks at every communication the Marquis
received—for it might be from <span class='it'>her</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Roland’s first constraint was over, and the meal
had proceeded a little way, the Marquis enjoined the
young man to give a most particular account of all his
doings. Roland assumed the air of obeying to the full,
though as a matter of fact he contrived to make his narrative
begin with his arrival in Paris. But this the Marquis
would not have.
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can only earn my full pardon, Roland,” he said,
looking at him quizzically, “by an equally full confession
of your sins—and by revealing the names of all your
accomplices!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte and the Abbé both exclaimed at this. “No
gentleman could consent to receive his pardon on such
terms,” declared the former.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true,” admitted the inquisitor, “that I know
Roland’s partners in guilt already. The one I have already
dealt with; the other, I am afraid, lies outside my jurisdiction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, there was another, was there?” asked the Abbé,
looking amusedly across at poor Roland, who, blushing,
was alternately studying the tablecloth and sending
appealing glances at his leader. “I know of one. Who
was the other? Not our staid Lucien, surely?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied M. de Kersaint, smiling, “not Lucien.
I have strong reasons to suspect another member of Artamène’s
family, no less daring than himself, and, presumably,
even more inspiring.—But enough that I know the name
of this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. person.—Go on, Roland; after all we will
dispense with the meetings of the conspirators at La
Vergne. Continue from your leaving that nest of plotters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in better spirits than he had been for days;
and how should Roland guess with what pleasure he was
looking forward to an interview after supper where, after
all, he should let the penitent off rather easily? Thankfully
escaping from the dangerous neighbourhood of Mlle
de la Vergne the young man carried on his narrative up to
his falling unconscious at the foot of the statue of Mercury
in the park of Mirabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint leant back in his chair. “We now
come, I think, to the really romantic part of the story, do
we not? Enter Mme Vidal, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Roland embarked on the entry of Mme Vidal into
his recital the Abbé and M. de Brencourt became very
silent. (But Roland noticed nothing; <span class='it'>his</span> audience was
M. de Kersaint.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost immediately, however, the latter interrupted
him. “What was she like to look at, this good angel?”
he enquired, laying down his fork. “She was not young,
that I have gathered.”
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland was rather at a loss. “I am afraid I am not very
good at description, sir. But M. le Comte or M. l’Abbé”—he
turned towards them—“surely you have heard all
about her appearance from them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed I have not,” replied the Marquis.
“Rather remarkably, they neither of them seem able to
describe her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us have your attempt, then, Roland,” said the
Abbé. A vista of blest possibilities was opening out
before him. The same thing was happening to the Comte
de Brencourt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only the possibilities were not blest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland tried, but possibly through the hostile influence
of the gentleman at the bottom of the table he failed to
achieve anything recognisable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Tall, fair hair going grey, blue-grey eyes’—that does
not advance us much,” observed M. de Kersaint with truth.
“It is like the passport descriptions, ‘bouche moyenne,’
and the rest. Never mind Mme Vidal’s appearance,
then, Roland. But since you of the three had the most
intimate acquaintance with her, tell us, at least, what
impression her personality made on you. For though
M. le Comte does not seem to find the presence at Mirabel
of a concierge with Royalist sympathies extraordinary,
I must say that I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said, Marquis, if I remember,” interposed M. de
Brencourt rather hoarsely, “that I thought her sympathies
need not have been so entirely Royalist as you
assume. She was a woman, M. de Céligny an interesting
young man, helpless and wounded .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. que sais-je? It
was enough to appeal to any woman’s heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland, embarrassed at hearing himself described in
these terms, and in such an unpleasant voice, broke in,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh but, indeed, Monsieur le Comte, she had Royalist
sympathies. At least she was the widow of a poor Royalist
gentleman .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for of course, Messieurs, you saw at once
that she was a lady. Indeed, I could not quite understand
why she accepted the post, for she certainly seemed
out of place in it. Didn’t you think so, Messieurs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did, certainly,” said the Abbé quietly. The vista
was opening out into a regular Heaven. The Comte was
understood to say that he had hardly seen her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It certainly does seem extraordinary,” mused the
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>
Marquis, leaning his head on his hand, his eyes fixed on
Roland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had seen her, sir, you would have thought so
still more,” said Roland with eagerness. “She had a
carriage, always, and a way of speaking when she forgot
herself—what I mean to say is, that if it hadn’t been so
patently absurd to think so, one might even have taken her
for a grande dame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why,” asked the Abbé softly, “would it be so
patently absurd to have taken her for one? Stranger
things have happened in the topsy-turveydom of to-day.
I have heard of Chevaliers of St. Louis working as stevedores
at a German port, and we all know how many émigrés
in London earned——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt broke in upon him rudely. “Pshaw,
Abbé, you are too romantic, and so is M. de Céligny. You
forget, I have seen the woman too, and though undoubtedly
superior, she was nothing out of the way, and as unlike
the paragon of our young friend’s poetic fancy as——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As falsehood is unlike truth,” finished M. Chassin, looking
straight at him. “Well, we differ, Comte, in our estimate
of what is ‘out of the way,’ that is all. I am with M. de
Céligny’s.—Go on, my son. You think one might even
have taken her for a grande dame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stuff and nonsense,” muttered M. de Brencourt
angrily, pushing away his plate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really,” said the Marquis, as this little passage of arms
ended, “your Mme Vidal begins to intrigue me so much
that I almost wish I had gone to Mirabel myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, if only you had!” was drawn in a whisper from
the Abbé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Kersaint heard, though he was not meant to,
and raised his eyebrows. “Why, it was your representations
which prevented me from going!” he exclaimed.
“What is the matter, Monsieur de Brencourt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” replied the Comte, who had half risen from
his seat. “For the moment I thought—it was nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hear that testimony, Monsieur le Comte?” said
the Abbé, turning to him with a sudden air of combat.
“You should be pleased with me—M. le Marquis acknowledges
that it was my wise counsels which prevailed on him
not to go in person to Mirabel!”
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why the deuce do you suppose I should be pleased
at that?” demanded the goaded gentleman. “M. de
Kersaint was welcome to go to Mirabel if he wished, for all
it mattered to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“How very rude he is!” thought Roland, displeased.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would not, surely, have had our leader run into
such danger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, <span class='it'>I</span> had to run into it!” retorted the Comte.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—<span class='it'>and succumbed</span>!” returned the priest with such a
world of meaning in his voice that the Comte changed
colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Abbé,” interposed the Marquis, “are you not
being ungenerous to a less fortunate rival? You are surely
not casting it up at M. de Brencourt that he endured a brief
captivity for the King’s cause?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé shook his head. “M. le Comte knows that
I am not,” he replied. “But I am afraid that we are
checking Roland’s interesting recital by our divergences
on the subject of Mme Vidal. If he will forgive our bad
manners .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, go on, Roland,” said the Marquis. “But you
must eat too. You were telling us about your actual
entry into the château.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got as far as Mme Vidal’s room,” resumed Roland
obediently, “and then I suppose I fainted again, for the
next thing I remember is finding myself in bed there, and
Mme Vidal bending over me again.—Ah, by the way,” he
cried, suddenly remembering something which might
serve as a contribution to portraiture, “there was one
curious little fact about her which I forgot to mention.
It was then that I first noticed it. One of her eyes, though
they were almost blue, had some brown specks in it. Did
you remark it, Monsieur l’Abbé? It was the right eye.
You could only see it when she was quite near you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did not observe it,” said the Abbé.
He spoke as if a strong wind of sudden origin had somehow
taken away his breath. From the lower end of the table
came the sound of a man drawing his sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember I used to look at it when she nursed me,”
went on Roland, happy at producing some effect in the
end. “And I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was interrupted by a voice he scarcely knew. “She
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
had eyes, you say, almost blue, with brown specks in
one?” gasped the Marquis, jerking forward in his chair.
“Did I hear rightly? Blue eyes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which one had
the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. say it again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a dead silence, and much embarrassed thereby,
Roland repeated his observation. The Marquis de Kersaint,
leaning forward in his chair, his left hand clutching
the table, looked at him with eyes which seemed as if they
would drive through him, and as the young man, fascinated
by that extraordinary gaze, returned it, he saw his leader
slowly turn so pale that it looked as if every vestige of
blood had been drained away from his face. Even his lips
were the colour of paper. Next moment, without a word,
without even a gesture of apology, he had pushed back his
chair, risen from his place, and disappeared into his bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland fell back, smitten dumb with astonishment
and, staring at the door which had just closed, he did
not see the black and thunderous look which the Comte
de Brencourt darted first at him and then at the Abbé.
But in a moment the priest, too, was on his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be that wound of his,” he said quickly. “If
you will excuse me a minute, Messieurs?” And he, too,
went through the bedroom door. Roland saw his face
as he went; it was not inexpressive now. It wore a most
singular look of mingled gravity and exultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte de Brencourt and the unconscious author of
this scene were now alone. And just because the Comte
was looking as he did Roland felt that he must say something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid that M. le Marquis’ wound——” he began
timidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt gave a short laugh that was more like a
snarl. “His wound!” he exclaimed. “Well, yes, a
wound if you like—a sore, a festering sore! Mort de ma
vie, boy, what made you so observant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Observant!” repeated the puzzled Roland. “I don’t
understand you, Monsieur le Comte. Ought one not to
have noticed that M. le Marquis was—in pain. But the
Abbé——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on with your supper, in Heaven’s name!” broke in
the Comte roughly. He really looked like murder at that
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
moment. “You have done a pretty evening’s work, on
my soul—and I don’t suppose you are through with it
yet, either!” And, laughing again, he poured out and
drank off a glass of wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Roland, almost convinced that he was sitting at
table with a madman, was in no mood to obey him. He
merely stared at the second in command. Fortunately
it was only for a moment, for the bedroom door opened
again and the Abbé stood there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. de Kersaint wishes to speak to you, Roland,” he
said. Amazing thing—<span class='it'>he</span> looked pleased. Roland got
up, utterly bewildered. His interview—now? He knew
not what he had said or done to precipitate it, and apprehension
was so written on his face that M. Chassin put his
hand kindly for a moment on his arm as he passed him,
and gave it a little pressure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte de Brencourt now addressed the aumônier.
“Since your services, Monsieur l’Abbé, don’t seem after all
to be needed for this surprising seizure of M. de Kersaint’s,”
he observed, “perhaps you will be good enough to sit down
and finish your supper. These constant exits hardly tend
to good appetite!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flame of anger suddenly ran over the little priest’s
face. “It is <span class='it'>your</span> services that have been required these
many days, Monsieur de Brencourt,” he rapped out,
“and you know it! I have no wish to sit down to table
with you!” And turning on his heel he marched out of
the sitting-room and slammed the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stupefaction seized M. de Brencourt in his turn. He
<span class='it'>did</span> know then, that wily old devil—he had known all the
time! Why, in the name of all his saints had he not told
de Trélan? But anyhow de Trélan was in process of
enlightenment at this moment behind that door, for of
course he had had the boy in to question him further. In
a few minutes he would doubtless come out, and then—well,
there would probably be murder. For a little bloodshed
would hardly wash away this time what their encounter
the other evening had not availed to bring to
light.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For five minutes, perhaps, the Comte de Brencourt sat
there with a set face waiting for this to happen; then, as
no one emerged from the inner room, his fretted nerves
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
drew him to his feet and sent him out in search of the
Abbé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found him standing motionless under the moon and
stars just outside the farmyard—not far, to be exact,
from the pigsties, as would have been obvious to anyone
less absorbed. The Comte strode over to the cassocked
figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I ask what you meant by that remark you made
just now?” he demanded without preliminary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé drew himself up. “It is no good talking to me
in that tone, Monsieur de Brencourt,” he returned with
spirit. “I am neither a gentleman nor a layman, so <span class='it'>I</span>
can’t go out with you to the Moulin-aux-Fées.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly no one would ever take you for a gentleman,”
responded the Comte, his voice shaking with passion, “and
it takes a priest indeed to play the part you have played—a
spying hedge-priest——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is worse, Monsieur le Comte, spying or
lying?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Lying!</span>” ejaculated the Comte with vehemence.
“Don’t your books of moral theology tell you that keeping
quiet about a thing is as bad as lying about it? Why was
it more my business to tell the Duc de Trélan that his wife
is alive than yours, as you evidently knew it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me,” said M. Chassin, and he smiled. “I was
referring to something quite different—to the occasion on
which, in so many words, you told Mme Vidal that her
husband was dead—no tacit lie that! I think you are
rather betraying yourself, are you not, by referring to yet
another?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, go to the devil!” burst out M. de Brencourt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I knew where you were to go, Monsieur le
Comte,” was the priest’s answer. “No, seriously, I do
not wish to quarrel with you—even after the part you
have played. The situation that you have brought about
is much too grave for that. You must know that you
have done a thing which God may forgive but which man
will find it hard to. Listen to me, Monsieur de Brencourt,
I beg of you, before it is too late, and remove yourself from
the Clos-aux-Grives, from M. de Kersaint’s command
even——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt, thus adjured, exploded in an oath and
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>
struck the door of the pigsty so violent a blow that he
brought out an enquiring inmate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the God above us, Abbé, you go too far! Do you
suppose that I am going to run away from de Kersaint’s—from
de Trélan’s—from any man’s anger!—Forgiveness—I
have not asked for it! And when the Duc de Trélan
wants me he will know where to find me!” He swung off
in the direction of the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only wish I could hope he did <span class='it'>not</span> know where to
find you,” muttered the Abbé, gazing after his receding
figure, “for, short of a miracle, there will be a terrible
day of reckoning for this silence of yours!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the flood of joy and gratitude in his heart was too
potent; it swept away alike his disgust and his apprehension,
and by the pigsty wall itself M. Chassin fell on his
knees and covered his face, while the moon, but little
declined from her fatal plenitude of four nights ago, looked
down benignantly upon him.
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span></p>

<h2 id='b3c9'>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE CHOICE</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>The brief but acrimonious interview of M. de Brencourt
and M. Chassin had scarcely terminated when Roland de
Céligny emerged from his leader’s bedroom to the outer
room. He shut the door behind him quickly, and stood
there a moment with his back to it, curiously combining
the air of a sentinel and that of a fugitive. And indeed,
breathing rather fast, he was saying to himself, “No one
shall go in—not even the Abbé!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had just been witnessing something which, though
he did not fully understand it, he felt no eyes ought to
have witnessed; he was hot and shaken with the thought
that his own unwilling but necessary presence had been an
outrage.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But since he was there, as he knew, to answer
what he was asked, and since the Marquis de Kersaint could
ask anything of him, even to his life, he had stayed, and
averted his eyes through the storm of questioning, behind
which could be divined a man’s very soul on the rack—till
that final bowing of the proud, unhappy head over the
battered trinket that Roland had withdrawn from his
own neck and held out as proof irrefragable .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yet a
proof of what he still did not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was so agitated that it was only after a few seconds
of this self-imposed vigil that he realised he was facing an
empty room. The Abbé was not there, the Comte was not
there. And in a minute or two more, still hearing no
movement from within he thought, “I must not stay
here; he would not like it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I must tell the Abbé
something. But I must also contrive that no one else
goes in.” And, casting a glance on the wasted victuals of
that supper-table which he had been so instrumental in
breaking up, he went out.
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later he was knocking at the aumônier’s door.
M. Chassin, barely entered himself, opened it. His face lit
up when he saw who stood there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy, I am glad to see you! Come in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland still hesitated. “Are you alone, mon père?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely, my child. Come in!” He almost steered
him in. “Now sit down, and we will have a talk. I was
hoping that you would come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Roland would not sit down. In his young mind
he was afraid, if he did that, of being led into saying
more than he wanted to say. He did not know how much
he ought to reveal. As a matter of fact he hated saying
anything at all about what he had seen, but, bewildered
as he was, he felt that the Abbé had better be told something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing there by the bed, he began at the end. “I
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I ventured to tell the officer of the guard that no
one was to approach M. le Marquis to-night except through
you—because of his wound,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excellent! Very good indeed!” said the priest, and
he clapped him on the shoulder. Roland wondered a little
why he seemed so elated; to him, fresh from that scene
with his leader, it did not seem quite decent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are perhaps going to see him now, mon père?”
he hazarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid, my son! If ever a man’s privacy should
be respected, his should be at this moment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if you
have done what I prayed you might be doing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Monsieur l’Abbé,” besought the perplexed and
almost unhappy Roland, “what is it that I have done?
What is it all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me first what you did do?” said the priest. “No,”—for
the boy had instantly turned away and was showing a
disposition to go—“I do not want to hear anything about
M. de Kersaint. I can see from your face how you feel
about it. I only want to know this—how did you convince
him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if you did .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that Mme Vidal, who has some
brown specks in one of her eyes, was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. someone he had
known before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I showed him,” said Roland, looking at the floor, “a
little old locket she gave me when I left. And when he
saw that——” He stopped dead.
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” said the priest, putting a hand on his arm.
“When he saw that he was convinced, was he not? That’s
all it is necessary for me to know, my child. Please God
the rest will come right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, Monsieur l’Abbé, couldn’t you tell me <span class='it'>what</span> is to
come right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not just yet,” said M. Chassin, smiling. “But you
shall know soon. Anyhow, my son, you can go to bed,
as I hope you are about to do, with the reflection that
you have this evening done the best day’s work you ever
did in your young life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think you have not yet
had your scolding for going to Mirabel? No! Well, you
will never get it now——from M. de Kersaint.” And adding,
“Go to bed! God bless you!” he, to Roland’s astonishment,
bestowed upon him a hearty embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the author of so much disturbance, somewhat comforted,
lay down a little later by the side of Artamène and
Lucien, whose scrupulous abstention, on his request, from
all enquiries about his supper-party seemed a thing phenomenal,
an almost chilly lack. So, also, did the absence
of the little locket and its chain from Roland’s own neck.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>How well inspired M. l’Abbé Chassin, for his part, had been
to lie down to sleep that night almost fully dressed, was
proved at about a quarter to five next morning, when he
woke to find M. du Ménars, rather scantily clothed, standing
beside his bed. He blinked up at him a moment, for if he
had expected to be roused by anyone, it was by Gaston
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know where de Brencourt is, Abbé?” asked
the Comte’s next in rank. “He is nowhere to be found,
and I must see either him or the Marquis at once, the
Marquis by preference. But for that I want your permission,
as I understand he was not to be disturbed without
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has happened?” asked the Abbé, getting off the
bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cadoudal has just sent an express to say that the
English convoy with muskets and ammunition for the
Morbihan which he was expecting has arrived—arrived two
days ago,” he added, glancing at the open letter in his
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
hand, “but that, knowing M. de Kersaint to be in need of
both, and that he would probably be in a position to repay
him in kind later on, he detached one ship for us before it
unloaded, and directed it to put in at Sainte-Brigitte, and
as the wind is favourable it ought to be there this evening.
Splendid news—provided we can reach the coast quickly.
And of course we shall want every man we can get together
to cover the disembarkation, for the Blues are certain to get
wind of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will rouse the Marquis instantly,” said M. Chassin.
“Only do me the favour, Monsieur du Ménars, of
allowing me to see him first. He was much indisposed
last night.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>And a few seconds later, with Cadoudal’s despatch in
his hand, he was knocking gently on his foster-brother’s
door. Receiving no answer he tried the handle. To his
surprise it gave, so he went in, shutting the door quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was light, of course; had been light for long enough,
added to which the sun would soon be up. All the eastern
sky already expected him. But in the room there still
survived the pale, forgotten ghost of a candle flame, and the
open window was curtained over. And by the window,
fully dressed, his sound arm stretched out along the wide
ledge, his head sunk forward on that arm, sat Gaston de
Trélan asleep. At least he did not move until the priest
touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it?” he asked without moving. “I thought the
door was locked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I, Pierre,” answered the Abbé, his voice very
stirred. “Gaston, my brother .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his brother sighed, lifted his head, and pulled himself
up from the sill, stiffly, as if he had been there a long
time. In his one available hand he held something tightly.
He looked like a man who has had as much as he can bear
in this world, from whom shock has shorn away everything,
even the power to feel joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fell asleep, I think,” he said uncertainly. “I suppose
you have come to tell me, Pierre, that it is all a dream?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank the ever-merciful God, it is true. Look in
your hand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duc de Trélan obeyed him, opening his fingers with
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
difficulty, as if they too were stiff. And he gazed at the
little locket, at the worn, dangling chain, as a man sleepwalking
or entranced might gaze. Then he said, in one
and the same breath, “<span class='it'>It can’t, it can’t be true! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I must
start for Mirabel instantly!</span>” and rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé faced him. “Something is asked of you,
Gaston, before you meet her. As a soldier .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You did
not hear a horseman gallop into the yard a short time
ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sleepwalker shook his head mutely. “Who was
it?” he asked with indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A messenger in haste from Georges—with great news.
He brought this. M. du Ménars opened it, and is outside
now, waiting to consult you.” And he held out the open
despatch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wounded man transferred the locket to the keeping
of his hampered right hand, and took it. A quick touch of
colour shot into his face as he read, and he bit his lip hard.
Then, even paler than before, he held out the letter again.
“Tell du Ménars and de Brencourt to see to it then, Pierre.
I must start for Mirabel at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest said nothing, and made no motion to take
the despatch, but looked at him with some of his own
steady colour fading, a most unusual phenomenon. Ah,
was that inherent wilfulness going to ruin this also!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not approve?” said Gaston de Trélan sharply.
“But how could you understand! I would go to her
over a world in flames!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And over your own honour, too?—Gaston, Gaston,
reflect a moment, I implore you! Do not spoil this almost
incredible miracle that God has wrought for you by snatching
at it before the hour! See how she has been preserved
for you all these years, how wonderfully the knowledge of
it has come to light, and have patience a few days longer!
For this unexpected coming of arms—why, it is the fulfilment
of your greatest desire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a greater now,” said Gaston de Trélan, looking
far beyond him. “Are you human, Pierre, that you do not
realise it?” Cadoudal’s despatch was almost crumpled
to nothing in his clenched hand; he became aware of it.
“Take this, before I—But, my God, that it should have
come to-day!”
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This time the priest accepted the letter, and retained the
hand that gave it him as well. “Mon frère, consider!”
he said pleadingly. “It only means the shortest of delays.
You can hasten to Mirabel afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said his brother with an indescribable intonation,
“If you will guarantee that I shall still be alive—<span class='it'>afterwards</span>!”
And he withdrew his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There indeed lay the hazard, and they both knew it.
Disabled, too, as he was, he might well be killed before
that meeting could take place, for there would be fighting
over this business of the convoy. And death, the long
desired, had terrors for him now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless the little priest did not budge. Gaston
would thank him for it, he knew, when his brain was clear
of this tremendous shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my first duty is to her,” went on the Duc de Trélan
with all his old stubbornness. “I can never offer her
sufficient reparation; at least what I can offer her shall be
instant. And—she may be in danger there! I have plenty
of competent officers; de Brencourt, du Ménars can handle
the men as well as I for this affair. It will not amount to
more than a skirmish at most—perhaps there will be no
collision with the Republicans at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why,” said the Abbé very low, looking at the
floor, “did you speak just now of the possibility of your
falling yourself before you and she could meet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His shot went home. The tired eyes flashed like steel.
“Pierre!” said the Duc de Trélan in a warning voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest raised his head. There were tears in his
own eyes. “The men are untried, Gaston, most of them.
They will follow <span class='it'>you</span>, but who really knows whether they
will follow du Ménars? And the Comte de Brencourt—no
one knows where he is. There may be no big engagement
with the Republicans over this business, but it will be
no easy task to cover the disembarkation and get the arms
away from Sainte-Brigitte. You are a soldier; I do not need
to tell you that. With these peasants it will need the
most skilful leadership. And .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to throw away, after
all our prayers, the chance of arming Finistère! My brother,
my brother .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his brother had already turned away and was at the
window, his back to him, and the priest heard him say in a
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
stifled voice, “Finistère, Finistère .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O my God, what a
refinement of cruelty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was up now; the curtain could not withhold it.
In the silence could be heard the tread of M. du Ménars as
he walked up and down in the room outside—waiting.
Pierre Chassin looked at the crumpled despatch that he
held, and its characters seemed to him like the writing
on the wall. Yet how natural was the impulse to disregard
it—how brutal to stand in the way of disregarding
it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But because he loved the man by the window so
much he struck again at him, and harder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said just now, Gaston, that your first duty was
to your wife. Yes, I think it is, but only because your
duty to your King and your position coincide with it—risen
though she be from the dead. Think for a moment
of her—what she would choose—not of your own most
natural desires! Which would she have, that you should
be false to your trust in order to hasten to her, or that you
fulfil it first, setting her second .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even” his voice shook
a little, “even if need be, that you should die in fulfilling
it. O—forgive me, my brother—you know which she
would have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gaston gave no sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, too,” resumed Pierre rather brokenly,
“for saying things so harsh <span class='it'>now</span>! But this is the testing-moment;
you will never meet another more crucial. You
could not lay before your noble wife a nobler reparation
than this—to put your fidelity to a trust before the instincts
of your own heart.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words died away as his own heart sank. And had
he gone too far? He knew that no other man would have
ventured to say a tithe as much to that haughty and
wounded spirit. But he knew, too, with conviction,
that Gaston’s better self must echo every cruel word.
And as the tall figure still stood motionless, the forehead
leaning on the bent left arm against the frame of the
curtained window, Pierre Chassin prayed as he had not
prayed even for their reunion, that the man faced with so
tense a choice should not fail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, you have seen her,” said the Duc at last,
breaking the vibrating silence, but in a voice that told how
slowly mental circulation was coming back to him. “You
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
have seen her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. spoken with her! Pierre, you knew all
this then—knew and never told me!—Concierge at Mirabel!
It is like a nightmare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed there was much to explain—but not now. “I
only knew at the eleventh hour,” said the priest quickly.
“And under the seal, Gaston; so I could not tell you.
My promise to you prevented my telling her before I had
time to consider whether I were justified in breaking it.
That time was never given me; but had I not had to
leave in such haste I should have told her. But—listen,
Gaston, for God’s sake—all may yet come right of itself,
for I pressed her so strongly to come to Brittany in person
to see the ‘Marquis de Kersaint,’ giving her full directions,
that I fully believe she will come. And if the sword lies
between you and that meeting she would urge you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To take it up,” said the leader of Finistère. “Yes, yes.
You are right. I don’t see things clearly this morning.”
He drew a long breath, jerked back the little curtain from
before the casement, and the risen sun entered gloriously.
Then he turned round, his figure dark against it, and said,
in his voice of everyday,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell du Ménars to come in, Pierre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé went quickly up to him and kissed him.
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span></p>

<h2 id='b3c10'>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>“AFTERWARDS”</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Not Artamène de la Vergne himself had received the command
to boot and saddle, which set the Clos-aux-Grives in
such a pleasurable commotion at sunrise that morning,
more jubilantly than Lucien du Boisfossé. None of the
three had been more thrilled than he with the joyful news
about the English frigate and its cargo, and the prospect
of a brush with the Blues before that cargo could be
secured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But alas for those bright anticipations! The youthful
philosopher was destined to have no hand in disembarking
barrels of powder on the beach of Sainte-Brigitte. Because
M. de Kersaint considered him the youngest officer with a
head on his shoulders—how gladly would poor Lucien
have foregone that flattering opinion!—he had been left
behind with thirty men or so to guard the deserted headquarters.
And there, late the next afternoon, he still was,
trying to read Rabelais in the empty ‘nursery,’ in spite
of a headache. For on top of his head, bandaged up like
a mummy’s, there was a fairly extensive sabre cut—though
there had been no fighting at the Clos-aux-Grives. But
Lucien had seen some rather murderous fighting, for all
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was M. de Brencourt who was the <span class='it'>fons et origo</span> of that
headache—M. de Brencourt who had so mysteriously
disappeared, who could not be found for any searching
before the column started on its march to the sea .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but
who had just as mysteriously reappeared, about four hours
after its departure, to fall into such a paroxysm of rage and
despair when he learnt what had happened as Lucien hoped
never to witness again. It was plain that the Comte
feared Lucien and everyone else would attribute his strange
defection (of which he offered no explanation) to cowardice,
an idea which had never entered the youth’s head, and
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
which he endeavoured tactfully to convey to his superior
would enter the head of no living man who knew him. In
the end the Comte did what du Boisfossé had seen from the
first he would do—rode off like a madman along the road
to the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a couple of hours he was back again, his roan horse
a lather. It seemed that when he had got a certain distance
he had heard a piece of news which had sent him back as
hard as he could gallop. The Blues had got wind of the
convoy, and it seemed likely that they would attack the
Chouans in force from the far side of Sainte-Brigitte. That
could not concern M. de Brencourt now, but what had
sent him back was the news that a smaller body—of cavalry,
it was said—were probably setting out to fall upon their
rear from the north-east. This contingent would pass
within some six or seven miles of Lanvennec. And, since
every available Chouan in the district who possessed arms
had gone with the Marquis de Kersaint, M. de Brencourt
proposed to take the headquarters guard, all but a man or
two, and ambush this column at a certain ford which it
must cross—if he could get there in time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not for Lucien to protest; M. de Brencourt was
not merely his superior officer, but the second-in-command.
And the youth was only too pleased at the prospect of
seeing some fighting after all, and perhaps doing a great
service to his departed comrades. For this was how its
originator seemed to regard the enterprise. So they set
out, and they did get there in time, and yesterday, almost
at this hour, Lucien had found himself, musket in hand,
kneeling with the rest behind a fringe of willows on the
bank of a broadish stream. And as they waited, and the
willow leaves tickled his nose, M. du Boisfossé, who had
only just learnt from the Comte the numerical strength of
the enemy, began to realise that thirty men, even posted as
they were, with all the advantage of a surprise, could hardly
hope to stop or account for two hundred and fifty horsemen,
and that M. de Brencourt was doing something that was a
great deal more than rash. Could it be that he wanted
to get himself killed? If so, he possibly had a right to
indulge this fancy, but hardly to include him, du Boisfossé,
and the major part of the headquarters guard in his desire.
However .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, looking back on yesterday’s mêlée, the young philosopher,
though he had no reason to modify this view of the
Comte’s motives when he remembered how recklessly that
gentleman had exposed himself throughout, knew at
least that the second-in-command could congratulate himself
on having caused the foe, after all, something worse
than confusion and delay. For the Republicans, counting
presumably on annexing the English muskets to their
own use, had with them, and in the front of the column too,
some empty ammunition waggons, and these were their
bane. At the very first volley, poured into their unsuspecting
ranks just as they were about to ford the
stream, the now riderless horses of one of these waggons
had dashed down into the river, and being there instantly
shot, and the waggon overturned by their dying struggles,
the narrow passage was for some time entirely blocked,
while a hail of bullets came from the invisible marksmen
on the opposite bank. Undoubtedly the Blues lost their
heads in the surprise of it, or they would have rushed the
ford and discovered how lightly it was held, but in the turmoil
many saddles were emptied before the passage was
clear. When at last they splashed over they were in too
much haste to investigate the willows, but their infuriated
rear ranks, without drawing rein, did use the sabre on anyone
they could see—and Lucien happened to be one of
these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He woke up to find himself lying on the trampled,
muddy bank, amid a strong smell of bruised peppermint.
M. de Brencourt himself was bathing his head, and told him
that he had had a nasty knock, but that, luckily, the blade
had turned. Two of their men had been less fortunate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the ford! Lucien dreamed of it that night; yet
what he still saw with most particularity was none of the
slain cavalrymen, but one dead rawboned chestnut horse,
which lay pathetically with outstretched neck in the stream
which was not deep enough to float it, the cut traces bobbing
on the current.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the youth, relieved of his command, since the
Comte was at the farmhouse, sat in the nursery and longed
for its other occupants. M. de Brencourt had been unwontedly
genial to him, and really solicitous about his
hurt, but his manner was sometimes very strange, he was
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>
restless to an extraordinary degree, and looked as if he
had not slept for nights. And though rumours were beginning
to come in of the complete success of the expedition,
rumours indeed that it had beaten off the enemy and was
on its way back with what it had gone to fetch, M. de Kersaint’s
chief of staff seemed in no way uplifted by them.
Lucien could not make him out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in fact thinking about him now when the door
of the nursery opened a little way and a small barefooted
boy looked timidly in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo!” said the young man. “What do you want,
mon gars? Come in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, go in, child, and tell us what you want,” commanded
de Brencourt, appearing at that moment behind
him. “Why, you are from the Ferme des Vieilles, are you
not—Le Blé-aux-Champs’ brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy, half frightened, half alert, looked up with dark
eyes at the gentleman who had him by the shoulder. “Yes,
Monsieur le Comte.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You came to see if he was back, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Monsieur le Comte. I came on a message,” said
the boy, rubbing one bare and dirty foot against the ankle
of the other. “I knew they were not back. But soon they
will be. There is dust hanging over the road from the
sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, a good scout already,” observed M. de Brencourt,
releasing him. “How is that head, du Boisfossé?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better, thank you, sir,” responded Lucien politely.
“How soon do you think they will be here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte gave an odd little movement of the shoulders,
as if to say that the matter did not interest him. He was
certainly very strange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, and what did you come here for, child?” he asked
carelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only to say that there is a lady from Paris at our farm,”
responded the small messenger, “and that she wishes to
wait on M. le Marquis when he returns. That is all,
Monsieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed, however, to be more than enough for the
Comte de Brencourt. He grabbed hold of the small
shoulder again, almost throwing the child off his
balance.
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you say! A lady from Paris asking for the
Marquis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the boy, wriggling; and his face turned
sulky, just like his elder brother’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, go on!” said the Comte, shaking him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing else,” muttered Mercury. “She came
yesterday. She is waiting. And when M. le Marquis
returns .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let me go, Monsieur le Comte—I have to
drive the cow home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without another word M. de Brencourt dragged the
boy out of the room. The expression on his face was
startling. So was the amazement on Lucien’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And about two minutes later the young man was craning
his swathed head recklessly out of the window. There had
been a sudden clatter of hoofs on the cobbles of the yard,
but the rider was already gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” thought M. du Boisfossé, “the mysterious lady
may have intended to interview M. le Marquis, but I think
it is M. le Comte whom she will see first. Here, perhaps,
is some explanation of—everything! Oh, why are Roland
and Artamène not back!”</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>They were not far away. That dust above the road from
the sea hung over a column winding triumphantly along,
with a string of country carts in its midst piled high with
the cases and barrels which, since dawn, they had been
receiving from the English sailors on the beach at Sainte-Brigitte.
The Chouans were intoxicated with their success;
had they not yesterday, before ever arriving at the little
bay, routed what seemed to them a huge body of Blues;
had not hostile cavalry, too, broken harmlessly during the
night on the covering force which M. le Marquis had so
wisely stationed on the road to protect his operations?
Vaguely they themselves realised that they had been
brilliantly handled, and assented without hesitation to the
opinion of hardbitten veterans of former wars like Sans-Souci
and Fleur d’Epine when they said, “We have a great
general—another Charette, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the head of his victorious array, rather weary from
strain and want of sleep, his right arm still in a sling, but
erect and easy as ever, rode Gaston de Trélan on the beautiful
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
black horse which had once been Marthe de la Vergne’s.
By his side was M. du Ménars, and the two were already
discussing the best method of distributing the muskets
and ammunition through the department, and how far they
would meet their needs till the gold of Mirabel could procure
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, this is an excellent beginning,” observed M. du
Ménars contentedly. “We shall be in soon now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
wonder if we shall find any news of de Brencourt when we
get back? His disappearance at this juncture is the most
inexplicable thing I ever heard of. Has it occurred to you,
Marquis, that it might conceivably be the result of foul
play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His leader looked round at him, evidently startled.
Du Ménars knew that he had had very little time for any
speculation about his missing subordinate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Foul play?” he ejaculated. “No, I had not thought
of that. I know no more than you why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>My God</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his horse suddenly bounded forward as if he had
unconsciously driven in the spurs. Checking him, he
turned his head sharply aside, then addressed his aide-de-camp
over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur de Céligny, have the goodness to ride back
till you come to the Abbé, and tell him that I must speak
to him at once. I will wait for him here, by the side of the
road. Don’t halt the column, du Ménars; go on and I will
catch you up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as Roland turned to obey he rode across to the
side of the road, and sat there waiting while the ranks
trudged past. In these, sooner or later, would come the
Abbé, who always marched with the men. At last the
priest came abreast, and stepping aside, stood by the black
horse and its rider, while the loaded carts and their escort
passed. When the embroidered jacket, baggy breeches
and wide-brimmed hat of the last Chouan had gone by, his
foster-brother swung off his steed. His face was fearfully
stern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pierre,” he said in a voice unlike his own, “a terrible
thought has just come to me. I cannot understand why
I have not had it earlier. As de Brencourt knew my wife
in the old days,” he paused; the priest guessed only too
well what was coming, “—as he knew her personally, he
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>
must have been aware that she was alive—was at Mirabel—and
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>deliberately kept the knowledge from me!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest looked down at the dusty road. “I am afraid
that he did, Gaston.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>God!</span>” said Gaston de Trélan, and smote his fist upon
his saddle. The thoroughbred reared a little, and the
Abbé caught the reins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tried to force him to tell you. But my own position
was so difficult,” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To keep silent after I had consented to meet him,”
exclaimed the Duc, his eyes blazing, “after he had taken
my hand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it revolts me! I can hardly believe it—be
quiet, Zéphyr!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was mad, I suppose, at seeing her again,” said the
priest, shaking his head. “It has revolted me, too. Perhaps
his disappearance—Where are you going, Gaston?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For M. de Trélan, already back in the saddle, was turning
his horse’s head in the opposite direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must get away for a little,” he said, very grim. “This
is a thunderbolt—horrible. I must have time to get
accustomed to it before I can face anybody. Go on after
the men, Pierre; do not get left behind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set spurs to his horse in earnest; Zéphyr went half
across to the opposite bank, tried vainly to get his head
down, and next moment was going down the road like an
arrow, and, annoyed at his cavalier treatment, pulling so
hard that for a moment or two his rider thought that he
would prove too much for his bridle hand, and regretted
his disabled right arm. The struggle for mastery, however,
gave him some physical relief in the black whirlwind
of repulsion and horror that had broken on him. Between
the demands of leadership and the overwhelming news
about his wife, he had had no time or inclination these
two days to think out the part de Brencourt had played—scarcely
time, indeed, till this homeward march, to think
of him at all, in spite of his singular disappearance. And
now the realisation of the Comte’s cold-blooded treachery
and deceit, coming on top of his provocations, on top of the
duel, on top of his own sparing of him, despite his resolve
to the contrary—for Gaston de Trélan was no more exclusively
right-handed than another—and, most repulsive
of all, on top of their reconciliation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was surely
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>
enough to put any decent man beside himself, and how
much more the man who had been his victim! He turned
Zéphyr on to a track that made for the lande, and for a
space, in which time hardly seemed to exist, galloped him
madly over the heather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually he began to regain control over himself, too.
The man had probably taken himself off for good; though
he could never forgive him, nor forget what he had done,
he would not be called upon to meet him again. And he
had not succeeded in his devil’s work. So he himself would
rather think of this tremendous news of Valentine’s survival—if
indeed it were not after all some mistake, some
cruel imposture, which he would discover for such when he
got to Mirabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>—No, the evidence was too strong! She <span class='it'>was</span> there—no
impostress, but the real Valentine; not the dead
Valentine whom he had grown to love and look to, but
the living. And so their meeting was to be in this world
after all—though he himself in the last few days had so
nearly gone to another. And how would the living Valentine
receive him? Perhaps she would altogether turn
from him. Could he blame her if she did?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rode off the lande by way of the Ferme des Vieilles,
Zéphyr by this time quieted, indeed exhausted. “Poor
Zéphyr!” said his master remorsefully. “Because I
have been treated like a brute, I have treated you like
one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he drew near the farm he saw the old mother of the
family outside, violently agitating her arms and crying,
“Monsieur le Marquis! Monsieur le Marquis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew rein. “What is it, mother? Your sons are
safe; Le Blé-aux-Champs has done very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman’s wrinkled face lighted up. “Ste. Anne
be praised! But it is not that, Monsieur le Marquis. I
thought I had better make sure if you had met the lady
out there on the lande—among the Stones, I think she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady! what lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have not come from the Clos-aux-Grives, then?
You have not had the message I sent by Yvot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What message?—No, I have not been there yet. Out
with it, in Heaven’s name!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lady has come from Paris to see you, Monsieur le
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>
Marquis; she arrived yesterday. So we gave her a bed
here—poor lying, but the best we could do till you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! Now! With you?” And in a second he
was on the road by her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ma Doué, Monsieur le Marquis, how you startled me,
getting off so quickly! No, she is not here now—she went
out on the lande a little while ago, and I thought I saw
her walking in the Allée. Being from Paris she does not
understand how evil they are, the Old Ones, about sundown,
though I warned her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bless us, Monsieur le Marquis,
you look as if someone had put a spell on you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For, stricken with an odd silence, and very pale, the
leader of Finistère had taken a step or two backwards,
till he was brought up by his horse’s quarter, and there he
was staring at her, his hand to his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it is the breaking of a spell, please God!” said he,
recovering himself. “I will go and find this lady on the
lande. It may be that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that she will not return to
you, Mère Salaun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took Zéphyr by the bridle, and went back on to the
heather. But, once out of sight, he drew a long shuddering
breath, and throwing his arm over Zéphyr’s crest, pressed
his forehead against the warm satin of his neck, and so
remained for a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Zéphyr, convinced by now that the master he knew
had returned to him, put his head round and lipped at his
shoulder. Then he cocked his little ears and listened.
Far away, the beat of another horse’s hoofs was audible
on the highroad. His rider gave no sign of having heard
it, but in a moment or two took the bridle again and went
forward towards the Allée des Vieilles.

<h3>AMONG THE WATCHERS</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Versailles, Dreux, Alençon, Rennes, Pontivy—like beads
on a chaplet they had slid past Valentine de Trélan, like
locks on a smooth river or canal, opened for her by that
bit of paper in Barras’ handwriting. She was herself
amazed by the ease of her journey, that journey which
was really a flight, hardly realising how much things were
changed from the days, for instance, of the Terror, and
how many people travelled comfortably now-a-days and
contrived to elude showing their passports if they were
out of date. And she had in her possession something
much more potent than a mere passport. Whether she
were taken for a political power, or for one of the many
ladies in whom the raffish Director was interested—or for a
combination of both, like Mme Tallien—Valentine neither
knew nor cared; at any rate whenever she produced the
laissez passer she was shown deference—till she got into
the country districts of that land of the leal, farther Brittany.
Here the municipalities indeed were Republican,
but at one or two small places where she had to halt Barras’
signature commanded anything but reverence, though it
had to be obeyed. Twice she distinctly heard the word
“spy” whispered of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But once she had passed Scaër and was in full Finistère
it was better, for here she could use the private directions
which the Abbé had given her. And it was by the employment
of these that she finally arrived, without mishap, at
the Ferme des Vieilles, to which the Abbé had directed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little old farmhouse by the roadside looked at her
cunningly and rather inhospitably, she thought, from its
tiny peering windows. Beyond it was a wide stretch of
moorland with heather, and, in one place, long strange rows
of upright stones. She descended from the farmer’s
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>
hooded cart by which she had replaced the diligence at
her last stopping-place and knocked at the open half-door.
Inside, a beautiful, grave and dirty little girl of six
or so, dressed in all respects like a grown woman of the
sixteenth century, stuck a finger in her mouth and stared
at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mignonne,” said Valentine, stooping over the half-door
“<span class='it'>Ema ar bleun er balan</span>—the broom is in flower.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tremenet er ar goanv</span>—the winter is past,” responded
an old woman, coming into view. “Enter, Madame!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later Valentine was being served with a
rough meal, the children standing round, awed, and she
had learnt all there was to know; how the Marquis de
Kersaint and practically all the officers from the headquarters,
even the aumônier, were gone to the sea to fetch
a convoy of arms, and that to interview the man whom
she had come so far to meet she must wait, probably, till
the day after to-morrow. Meanwhile Mère Salaun offered
her hospitality, premising (and justly) that it was not fit
for a lady from Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And indeed Mme de Trélan slept but ill that night in the
<span class='it'>lit clos</span> put at her disposal, though she had known in prison
much less comfortable sleeping-places. But it was not only
the unwonted experience of passing the night in a sort of
hutch which kept her wakeful, it was partly the dread lest
M. de Kersaint should never return from this expedition—for
she had been told there would be fighting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No news next morning, but a rumour that there had been
a fierce encounter between the Chouans and the Blues.
Valentine was restless. She would have liked to go to the
Clos-aux-Grives, but thought it would be unfitting; and it
was besides unnecessary, since Mère Salaun had instituted
the ten-year-old Yvot as a courier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she walked on the lande, where the wind blew over the
wide spaces, and tried to be patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are those great avenues of stones that I saw in
the distance this morning?” she asked at the mid-day
meal. “There seem to be miles of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those, Madame,” said her hostess, pouring out the
milk for the children, “are Les Vieilles, the Old Ones, the
Old Women. Some call them Les Veilleuses, the Watchers.”
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your farm is, then, named after them?” commented
Mme de Trélan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unfortunately,” replied Mère Salaun, compressing her
wrinkled lips. And seeing Valentine’s look of enquiry, she
went on, “They are not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not benevolent, Les Vieilles.
Do not go among them much, Madame, especially after
sundown, if you want to keep the wish of your heart. For
if they can they will take it from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a strange idea! “Who set them up?” asked the
Duchesse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mère Salaun shook her head. “We do not know. Fetch
Madame’s crêpe from the hearth, Corentine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Yvot fidgeted. “But, Madame,” he broke in,
in his shrill voice, “nobody set them up. A long while
ago they were a queen’s ladies, and a magician turned
them into stones. And on one night in the year, on
Midsummer Eve, they leave their places one by one and
go to the pool to drink—because you see, Madame, they
were alive once, and they are still thirsty. Some people
think they eat, too, and put food for them. And as they
go in turn to drink you can see the gold underneath, and
the rich ornaments, in the place they have left!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do people go on that night to take it?” asked
Mme de Trélan as he paused for breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yvot’s eyes grew bigger and his tanned little face paled,
while his grimy hand made a rapid sign of the cross over
himself. “God forbid! There was a man once—he went
to get the gold—folks begged him not to. He never came
back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what happened to him?” asked Valentine,
interested less in the tale than in the narrator—and somewhat
appalled at the gigantic pancake, nearly a quarter of
an inch in thickness, which had appeared before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The menhir came back from the pond and caught him!
He is underneath it to-day—the one they call La Bossue,
the Hunchback. You can hear him groaning and praying
to be let out sometimes. He has been there for seventy
years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this climax one of the smaller children burst into
tears, and Yvot was angrily commanded by his mother to
get on with his dinner. But she, too, signed herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless Valentine found herself among the stone
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>
avenues that evening. No news had come yet, but the
Allée was at such a short distance from the farm that if it
came she could easily be informed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she walked among the menhirs, Les Vieilles, Les Veilleuses,
and the menhirs watched her as she went, and she
knew it. They were yellow with lichen, rust-red with it,
grey with it; the heather was about their deep roots,
older than the oldest trees. Ancient, terrible, venerable,
four ranks of them, they marched for ever up the rise and
over it towards some invisible goal. Valentine de Trélan
with her forty-five years felt very young, very ignorant
beside them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had been here—planted by whom, and why?—long,
long before the overturned order of yesterday; long
before its pillars had been laid, long before Clovis and
Charlemagne; they would still be here when the name
of the last King of France was forgotten. As she stood
among them she knew that she was in the oldest place of
this old land of Armorica. They were the more living in
semblance, the more individual, these grey shapes, because
their slope was not alike, any more than their forms. Some
leant this way, some that; some were grotesque, some
more than grotesque; yet whatever were the purpose
that possessed them, it possessed them even terribly.
Valentine wondered which was the “hunchback” of the
evil legend .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She was afraid of them; and yet they
fascinated her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as she walked between their ranks she wondered
how much longer she would have to wait before she saw
the Marquis de Kersaint. How calmly, at the Ferme des
Vieilles, they took this fighting—all the men away with
M. le Marquis as a matter of course. Was it true, she had
asked, that Cadoudal in the Morbihan had ordered all his
young men not to marry for the present? Quite true.
And they were not marrying? No. What a people to
lead, and what a leader!</p>

<p class='pindent'>What should she do after she had talked with the
Marquis? It depended on what he told her. In any case
she was come to the beginning of a new chapter in what
was left to her of the book of her life. Would Gaston’s
name be on those pages—and in what characters would it
be written?
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a grey day, austere, not unbeautiful. Now,
at the approach of sunset, it was warming into a certain
splendour. The shadows of the watchers began to slant
across the avenue like scores of pointing fingers, and at
the other end the pine trees on the rise grew darker against
what would soon be a battlemented glory of cloud. And
after sundown it was sinister here, they said; Valentine
could believe it, but the watchers had some spell to make
one linger.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as she turned from looking at the distant pines
and the sunset that she became aware she was not alone
in the Allée des Vieilles. Some way off a man was standing
by one of the tallest menhirs; indeed, she almost thought
that he was leaning against it. It gave her a start at first
to find that, when she had thought she was alone, she was
being observed. He must have ridden up unheard on the
heather, for outside the double avenue a black horse was
bending its head towards that arid nourishment. All
she could see of its rider at this distance was that he was
tall, that he wore a long close-fitting dark redingote, that
he had a white sash round his middle, and a sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All at once she thought, “How stupid of me; it is a
Royalist, one of M. de Kersaint’s officers, probably, back
from the fighting. Perhaps it is even M. de Kersaint
himself, ridden over from his headquarters, on hearing
that I am here, to wait on me. That is very courteous
of him. But why, since he must see me, does he not move,
or come to meet me? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps, if he is from the fighting,
he is hurt.” And then indeed she saw that he carried
his right arm in a sling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began in her turn to go towards him. Still she
could not see his face; he had his hat rammed low over
his eyes. In the hat, as she now noticed for the first time,
was a white plume. That feather showed her that it must
be M. de Kersaint himself, and her heart beat a little faster.
Yet how strange of him to remain covered when, plainly,
he must see her advancing, and not to move a step to meet
her. But she went on nevertheless, till only ten yards or
so separated them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Royalist still stood motionless, the sunset glow
falling on him, watching her so intently that he gave the
effect of holding his breath. Valentine began to be a
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
little frightened; his behaviour was so unaccountable.
And suddenly the old Breton woman’s warning came back
to her. Was the wish of her heart, then, going to be reft
from her here among Les Vieilles; was she to learn from
this man, among the covetous old stones, that Gaston
was dead—to learn it this time without possibility of
doubt? Was that why he was so still—because he knew
her errand? She stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her stopping seemed to galvanise the watcher into life.
He moved a little forward from the menhir which had been
supporting him, and put up his left hand to his hat as
though to remove it. But still he did not take it off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame de Trélan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That voice! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She quivered as though she had been shot and put her
hands to her breast. “Dear God!” she said. “Who is
it? Who is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Valentine!</span>” said the voice again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in a single movement the Royalist officer uncovered,
flung his hat from him, and was at her feet. But even
with the previous warning of the voice, even with his
tardy uncovering, the shock was too much for a woman
who was no longer young. It was as one sees something
a long way off that she saw him kneeling there with bent
head; but when he raised it, and his face was visible, the
blood drummed in her ears. The grey watchers bowed
suddenly towards her, the heather began to give way
beneath her feet. “Gaston!” she sighed, putting out her
hands helplessly like a frightened child, “Gaston—I’m
falling! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” The heather gave way altogether.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The cold grey sea on which Valentine had been floating
hither and thither began a little to cease its swaying motion.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But how curious to be on a sea at all! Yet she could
hear it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no, it was the wind in the pine avenue at
Mirabel. But the pine avenue was nearly all cut down
now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was neither, neither. She was lying in strong
arms that held her close, against a heart whose pulsations
she could hear. It began to come back. That figure by
the menhir. O, Christ in Heaven!—but that was a
dream!
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet kisses, not the kisses of a dream, were being laid on
her closed eyes, her hair, her brow—though none upon her
lips—and with them went passionate words of supplication
for forgiveness, and words of a meaning far transcending
that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. words of love, heartbroken words. But he who
thus addressed her must have thought her still unconscious
when he dared to speak them, for when she opened her
eyes and stirred she was very gently laid down out of his
grasp upon the heather, and this Royalist officer who was
her husband knelt silently there beside her, with his face
buried in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that relaxing hold Valentine might have thought—a
thousand things—but, dizzy and confused though she
still was, she had heard, and felt. There was no room for
surmises or mistakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston,” she said faintly, lingering on the name.
“O Gaston .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if you are real .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your arms!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hands came down, and she saw his face, ravaged,
older, infinitely changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dare I hold you in my arms, Valentine?” He was
shaking as he said it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From where she lay she gave him one look, and held out
her hands the second time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O my wife, my saint!” said Gaston de Trélan, choking.
He stooped and gathered her once more to his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, after all, so unbelievable was it, that the long
embrace did seem to belong to another world than this—a
far world, but the only real.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That passed. The heather became heather again, the
air the air of earth. Somehow he was helping the living
Valentine whom he held to her feet, and was leading her
towards the nearest menhir—that indeed against which
he had himself been leaning. Directly he saw that she could
stand alone, and could take some support, if she wished it,
from the great granite finger, he threw himself on his knees
before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Valentine, this is where I should be!” he broke out
uncontrollably, “here, at your feet, not holding you in
my arms. I am not worthy of that, Valentine—Valentine,
how can I even ask for forgiveness? But I do ask for it—I
do ask! For seven years I have sought it, and I have
sometimes felt that you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where I thought you had
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
gone, had given it to me.” His voice broke, and, stooping
that proud head of his, he did literally kiss her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston, if you love me!” she cried out, trying to stay
him. “No, no .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and what talk is this of forgiveness?
O my darling, I was wrong too—stubborn and proud.
I should have gone with you—and afterwards .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you
never got my letters, I know it, but I should have written
again, made more efforts. O Gaston, if you love me,
don’t do that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifted his head. “Letters!” he said in a dazed
way. “You wrote .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you had no answer? I never
had them!—Valentine,” and there was anguish in his voice,
“you did not think I received them .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and left them
unanswered!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” she said. “No, my heart! We will talk
of that presently; there is so much to say. Only now,
Gaston—I cannot bear to see you kneel to me, my husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is more than that,” he said, not without
difficulty. “More than my having left you to face .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
horrors. The years before——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not remember the years before,” answered Valentine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least,” said he, very low, “the years since have
been yours alone.” And still kneeling there, but with his
arms about her, as she stooped to him he kissed her on the
lips.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Afterwards she sat propped against the menhir, and her
husband half sat, half knelt beside her, holding her hands
and gazing at her as at what indeed she was, one returned
from the dead. Very briefly, and only under the pressure
of his questions, for she, too, desired chiefly to contemplate
him, she had given him the outline of that past nine years,
sliding as quickly as possible over the massacres and her
subsequent year in prison, because he turned so pale that
she feared he would faint next. And he had been wounded
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but he said that it was an old injury—nothing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, Gaston,” she said breathlessly, “you—what
are you doing here with this M. de Kersaint? Is he really
a kinsman—is that why you are here? At first—before I
recognised you—I thought you must be he.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His grasp tightened on her hands, and before he answered
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
he put them to his lips. “You were not mistaken, Valentine.
That has been my name for seven years, since you
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. died. O, my wife” he almost crushed her hand,
“<span class='it'>are</span> you alive—is it not some phantasy, some illusion of
this place——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” she broke in, the colour rushing over her face
and fleeing again, “<span class='it'>you</span> are M. de Kersaint—it was <span class='it'>you</span>
at Rivoli—it is <span class='it'>you</span> who command Finistère for the King
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that scarf means——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quite suddenly she drew away her hands and putting
them over her face burst into tears.

<h2 id='b3c12'>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE CENTRE OF THE LABYRINTH</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>From the clump of pines on the rise the view down the
Allée des Vieilles, with the sunset light on it, was extensive,
and figures half a mile away were tolerably clear. The
Comte de Brencourt had learnt at the farm that he was too
late, but he had come on nevertheless. He had not reached
his vantage point in time to witness the actual moment of
meeting, but, though faces were of course indistinguishable
at that distance, he had seen enough. And, grinding his
teeth, with strange red spasmodic waves passing across
his eyesight, so that from time to time he could see nothing
at all, he still waited in the shadow of the clump. He had
not known why—till a few minutes ago, when they had
started to walk this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, he knew now why he had come, and why he had
endured that hell. But they walked so slowly—and he did
not want to kill her too. Her husband’s arm was about
her, and her head rested against him. Zéphyr followed,
with his incomparable grace of movement, trying now and
then to twitch a mouthful of something edible from among
the heather. They were only a couple of hundred yards
away now. What was this in his own hand—yes, of course,
his pistol. And it was not moonlight this time, but
strong level sunlight, falling in the right direction. A
hundred and fifty yards. His hand must not shake now.
But he must be very careful. If only de Trélan would take
his arm away, curse him! A hundred and twenty yards,
a hundred yards.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>If Valentine de Trélan had not worn that look, who
knows what might not have happened, whether the
menhirs would not have had their wish, and taken her
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>
heart’s desire from her. But what, when she was near
enough, he who loved her in his own fashion could read
on her face was both shield and sword. Crazed though he
was at the moment, it smote the pistol from his hand, the
very impulse to use it from his heart. The glory that she
wore was not forgiveness, or reconciliation, or the transient
joy of a great wonder, but absolute, perfect, rounded
happiness, tranquillised ecstasy. Then all those years
of desertion were nothing; all those years when Gaston
de Trélan had followed strange fires were nothing; all the
time in Mirabel, then, she had been thinking of him, had
perhaps gone there for the sake of his memory—all her
life, perhaps, she had been a ship beating against contrary
winds to a haven he had not thought existed. And now she
was in harbour—no doubt of that!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has the face of a saint in Paradise!” he said to
himself, trembling. At her husband’s he cast no look;
he mattered less than nothing to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vain, then, his own faithfulness to her, that had led him
into such crooked and faithless paths, vain his endeavours,
stained with his own dishonour, to keep them apart. She
had loved <span class='it'>him</span> all the time, and now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no more to say or do. <span class='it'>Ite, missa est.</span> Artus
de Brencourt stumbled down the slope, blinded less by the
sunset’s exultation as he turned than by that sight, mounted
and rode off, more cold and grey than the immemorial
watchers, with eyes from which not even hate looked out
any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, one thing remained to do, and that quickly. He
would have wished to return to the Clos-aux-Grives for a
few moments first, but that was impossible, for he would
risk meeting them—if <span class='it'>he</span> brought her there. Nor did he
want to do it too near headquarters. If he could light on
a place with sufficient cover there was a chance that his
body would never be found at all. He would prefer that—not
to give de Trélan the satisfaction of knowing how
thoroughly he had worsted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, surely, this oak thicket a little off the road would
serve, for the road was lonely enough. He could not wait
to find a better spot, for a thirst was on him to be gone.
He had done a thing for which there was no forgiveness
this side death—a thing for which he had no intention of
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>
asking forgiveness—and, what was far more terrible to him
had done it in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dismounted at the entry to the copse. What should
he do with his horse, whose presence might betray his
own? A moment’s reflection, and he turned the animal’s
head away from the direction of the Clos-aux-Grives, and,
drawing his sword, smote it hard on the flank with the flat.
The beast reared, capered, and bolted down the road.
Then, dropping the sword, M. de Brencourt plunged into
the thicket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not as dense as he had thought, but at the foot
of this oak tree he would be quite invisible from the road.
He had no last message to leave other than those he had
written on the night of the duel and, as it happened, left
undestroyed afterwards. He had no last thoughts, for he
was incapable of any thought but one, and as for prayer,
a man had no right to it who was doing what he was doing.
Nevertheless once familiar words drifted through his brain
and out again as he knelt down by the oak-tree’s strong old
roots, “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pray for us sinners now and in the hour of
our death” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but they scarcely had meaning, and his
mind seemed only a blank of wreathing fog as he put the
pistol to his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weapon remained there for perhaps eight seconds,
then sank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For there comes a point when the machinery that the
brain controls will not revolve any longer. Artus de Brencourt
had come to that point now. Ridden as he had
recently been with the most devastating emotions, torn
with hatred and more than half mad with jealousy, having
twice tried and failed to kill the man he hated, having
lived by day on the edge of a volcano and having scarcely
slept by night, he had now to face the most shattering
experience of all—itself the direct outcome of the others.
He lacked the nerve to kill himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only the tiniest muscular action was needed, the pressure
of a finger, and he had not the will power left for it.
Kneeling there, the sweat pouring off his face, he tried
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and could not. His hand would not even hold the
weapon in position. He who but a little while ago had
tried to steal another man’s life from him had not courage
left to take his own.
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The discovery, stark and sickening, broke the violent,
passion-tossed man to pieces, broke him utterly. Never
in his life had he known the taste of physical cowardice
till now. A horrible nausea came over him, and he fell
forward on his face at the foot of the oak tree and lay there,
beaten at last—lay there while an oak leaf settled on his
hair and his horse, returning, trotted past again in the
direction of headquarters. But he did not hear it.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Complicated emotions of some violence had assailed M.
Chassin when he reached the Clos-aux-Grives and heard
from Lucien the story of the ford, and how M. de Brencourt
had recently ridden off in haste—and especially when he
learnt why he had thus ridden off. And at that piece of
news—since the “lady from Paris” awaiting the Marquis
could be no other than Mme de Trélan herself—M. Chassin
also, abandoning his duties towards the wounded, rushed
out of the farmhouse, a prey at the same time to he knew
not what dire premonitions, and to a joy and thankfulness
beyond words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet where was he to go, and what was he to do? He
found himself setting out as fast as he could go for the
Ferme des Vieilles, become now a species of rendezvous.
But he had hardly gone a mile, his soutane well tucked up,
when between heat, fatigue and apprehension he was
asking himself why in the name of all the saints he had not
borrowed a horse. And instantly the saints sent him
one. It came trotting leisurely down the road towards
him, its bridle dangling, a riderless horse—more, a horse
that he recognised. It was the Comte de Brencourt’s
roan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé stood in the dust and smote his brow. What
did this portend? At any rate he would utilise the steed.
He caught it as it passed, girt his soutane still higher,
mounted and pursued his road. And as he went he looked
from side to side, but he would not have thought of entering
the oak copse when he came to it, had not his eye been
attracted by something that glinted at the side of the road—the
sword that lay there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé dismounted, without grace, and picked it up.
He seemed to have seen it before, though, after all, one
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>
sword was very much like another. Perhaps the thicket
would yield some explanation of the mystery. He tied
up the roan and went in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, in a sense, the thicket only yielded him another
mystery. For, on the root of an oaktree, with a pistol
lying on the ground beside him, was quietly seated M. de
Brencourt, writing something on his knee. M. Chassin,
having expected anything in the world but this sight,
stood speechless, his cassock tucked about his waist and
the drawn sword in his hand. After a moment the Comte
lifted his head, looked at him, and seemed, with an effort—or
that was the effect he gave—to recognise him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was writing to you, Abbé,” he said. “You are the
person I want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice, very flat and monotonous, was unlike his
own. So was his face. His eyes were someone else’s.
The Abbé did not like them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have your horse, Monsieur le Comte, and your sword,
I think,” he said, for want of anything better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said the stranger under the tree in his
dull, slow tones. “As I am leaving the district at once
it will be convenient to have them. Perhaps I had better
give you this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, still seated there, he handed up the piece of paper
on which he had been writing. M. Chassin, advancing,
took it, and read, in a nerveless handwriting, these words
addressed to himself:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You wanted me to go, and I am going—probably to join
M. de Bourmont in Maine, if he will have me. He is the
furthest away. I have tried to go further still, which would
no doubt have pleased you better, but——</span>” some words were
scratched out here. “<span class='it'>Since I am fulfilling your wishes,
perhaps you will do me the service to report my decision in
the proper quarter, and later despatch my personal effects to
me, for I shall not enter the Clos-aux-Grives again.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbé, dumbfounded, looked at the writer. Something
abnormal had happened: what was it? And
Gaston?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean this?” he stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” responded M. de Brencourt, without
moving a muscle of that expressionless face. “I have tried
to shoot the Duc de Trélan”—the priest gave an
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
exclamation—“and failed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he does not know it—you can
tell him if you like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I have tried to shoot myself
and failed. I do not wish to live, but if I cannot kill
myself, what other choice is there for the moment?” He
brushed some bits of dead leaf off his knees, put his pistol
back into his belt, and rising, held out his hand for his
sword. “Did I leave it in the road?” he enquired, in the
same emotionless way. “Thank you. I will try to have
you informed, Monsieur l’Abbé, if I am killed when the
campaign opens, as I trust I shall be; I expect you would
like to know. But you need not fear that I shall ever
seek to see either of them again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slipped his sword carefully back into the scabbard,
made the petrified priest a sort of salute, and went quietly
past him to the gap in the hedge where his horse was tied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And M. Chassin, who had come out prepared to fight
dragons, turned and stared after him dumbly, knowing not
whether to give thanks or no. For this time M. de Brencourt
had frightened him. But, just as the Comte got
into the saddle, he felt a sudden violent impulse to say
something that would pierce that terrifying calm. He
could not let him go like that. Calling to him, he hurried
to the gap and came out into the road beside him and his
horse. The Comte looked down at him with his mask of a
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur le Comte,” said the little priest earnestly,
“I have a feeling that some day, in spite of everything,
you will be given an opportunity of serving that lady
you have loved and wronged .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. May God forgive you
and go with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you; you are most kind,” said the mask
politely, and the roan horse moved forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his whilom adversary, so unexpectedly routed,
stood in the road thinking, “It is not in Maine, but in a
madhouse that he will find himself before he is much older!
God pity him! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But where can Gaston be—and she?”</p>

<h3>(3)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Could Pierre Chassin but have seen them they were
sitting under the pine-stems, unconscious of the lurking
death so recently withdrawn—sitting there very much as
they had walked thither, his left arm about her, her head
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>
on his breast; only now she held, with her own two hands,
that one hand of his fast against her, as if she feared it would
slip away again. Here was grass, a little distance from the
pines, and Zéphyr cropped it, and for a long while the
brisk, tearing noise of his browsing, the jingle of his bridle,
and the sough of the wind above them was all that they
could hear .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. since the hour was too solemn, too wonderful,
for further speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For they both knew now, if not all, at least the most
vital facts about each other. Now, for Valentine, the seven
years’ silence was explained—and could scarcely have had
a more honourable justification. Now the idea that Gaston
had not cared whether she were dead or alive seemed
blasphemy. How false, too, had been all those past conceptions
of what their meeting would be like, if ever they
met again! Nothing remained now of old wrongs, however
deep, nothing of old unhappinesses, however real, nothing
of old mistakes. All these were not, before the miracle of
his personal presence, the marvel of being in his arms. It
was as if hoar frost should change, under a stronger sun
than winter’s, into the spring’s diamonds of unimaginable
joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, as she rested on his heart, came on her, after the
wonder, the peace of Paradise. For this the watchers
seemed to have been planted; to this goal under the pine-trees
they ran up. Take her heart’s desire from her! why,
they had given it! She would never know how nearly
it had been snatched away as soon as given.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>As for the man against whose breast she leant, nothing
but what he held had reality for him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and even
she was not yet quite real. The few hours during which
he had known the nightmare picture in his mind to be
but a lying canvas were not sufficient to erase its effect.
The singe of his seven years’ purgatory (worse than hers,
because it had been purely mental) would not pass lightly
from him, though it would pass. And this of it burnt hot
in his mind now, even in these transcendent moments—the
subtle change in her, the hair tarnished from its glory,
the lines on the delicate skin, not to be accounted for
merely by the passing of time, but his doing, his fault!
If she had not fallen, there in the Allée, he would scarcely
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>
have ventured to touch her; had she not been (as he
thought) unconscious he would never have kissed her as he
had. She was too sacred, and too profoundly wronged.
Yet here she was in his arms, willingly, generously—too
great in mind to exact what a lesser woman would have
exacted. And before the depth of the love which had survived
all that hers had had to survive he was still, in spirit,
on his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sunset had burnt out before they stirred, yet the
wonderful hour had to end. Gaston de Trélan got up at
last and helped his wife to her feet, and then remained gazing
at her, almost tranced. And she looked at him, standing
there above that strange battle-array of stones, tall and
resolute, with the stains of march and fight still on him,
with almost everything of the young prince of the Mirabel
portrait gone. There was no rose in his swordhilt now.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She drew a long breath, and held out her hand to him,
and at the touch he woke, and led her down the slope
towards the black horse, who was to carry her to the
Clos-aux-Grives. But as they went she remembered
something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston,” she said softly, “I have not come to you
empty-handed. I, too, can give you something for the
cause, mon Général!” Withdrawing her hand from his
she brought out from its hiding-place and held out to him
the ruby necklace. “Like the gold, it comes from Mirabel;
it was given—I daresay you have heard by whom—to the
concierge of Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet her husband, with the jewels in his hand, did not
seem pleased. “But it is the Duchesse de Trélan who will
wear it,” he answered, drawing himself up. “Permit
me!” And, a little awkwardly by reason of his injured
arm, he contrived to clasp the heirloom round her neck—then,
catching her to him with a sudden gasp, said vehemently,
“Never speak to me again of Mirabel—of your
being there like that! I cannot bear it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Gaston,” she said, looking up at him, “when I
was there I thought of you nearly all the time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O my
dear, when you ride in triumph into Paris with the Royalists
of Finistère behind you, we two must make a pilgrimage to
Mirabel together. If it had not been for Mirabel—for the
treasure .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not finish, for she was strained too closely. And,
stooping his head, her husband kissed her—but not as he
had done on his knees in the heather, like a worshipper.
He kissed her like a lover. He was hers at last.

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>sang Marthe de la Vergne to the harpsichord in her light
sweet voice. The strains floated through the open salon
window to Valentine de Trélan as she sat outside in the
September sunshine. The music changed:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>“Should the King honour</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>My poor door;</span></p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Long before.”</span></p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>There was a thrill in the young voice. Yes, thought Mme
de Trélan, Marthe, if she had been a man, would certainly
have given her sword-arm and her store to-day; in fact
she had given them, in her brother, and—another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chords ceased; somebody had come into the room,
and Valentine recognised her hostess’s voice, though she
could not hear what she said. She resumed the embroidery
which she had put down to listen to Mlle de la Vergne’s
singing, but in a moment or two that had slipped to her
lap, and her thoughts were miles away—back at the Allée
des Vieilles, at the Clos-aux-Grives. Once more she rode
into the courtyard of Gaston’s headquarters on Gaston’s
horse, once more she renewed her acquaintance with Roland
and the Abbé Chassin; once more she lay in the little
room which her husband had given up to her—a soldier’s
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
wife, in a soldier’s bare environment. And once more she
was arranging Gaston’s sling for him—that sling for which
she could not learn the reason, since he evaded her questions
about his wound—and he suddenly caught sight of her
hands, not quite the white and exquisite hands he remembered,
and she perceived that the slight transformation
brought home to him almost intolerably the years
of which he could not bear her to speak. He had
broken down at the sight, and before she could quiet him
the palms of those hands, kissed over and over again, were
wet with his tears. Yes, the lover she had never known
she had now, and in those short five days together at the
Clos-aux-Grives, interrupted though their companionship
necessarily was, she had lived the only part of all her years
that was worth the living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, lover though he were, Gaston de Trélan had almost
instantly to sacrifice his happiness and hers. Even with a
woman to wait on her he would not have it said that the
chief of Finistère had his wife with him at his headquarters;
would not at any rate permit himself a privilege he would
not have accorded to any of his officers. He sent Artamène
to ask Mme de la Vergne if she would receive his wife
for a while—and so the brief idyll came to an end. For
nearly a fortnight now the Duchesse de Trélan—her identity
was no secret here—had been living, for the first time in
seven years, with women of her own class, of whom the
younger was already her slave. And she was happy here,
where she was made so gladly welcome; but her thoughts
had an incorrigible habit, as now, of flying away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For besides those hours with Gaston there had been
conversations with the Abbé Chassin, in which she learnt
what had at first puzzled her, why her husband had
changed his name; and to her Pierre Chassin revealed,
saying he thought he owed it to her as well as to his foster-brother,
something of the utter despair and grief of seven
years ago, and its sequel. He told her indeed, in so many
words, that the profound change in Gaston was due to her—to
her memory; but Valentine had both combated this
and said that there was no change—it was but the fruition
of what had been there all the time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fruition, yes—fruition of character, fruition of prayer.
She had prayed and longed, and lo, after years, here was
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>
the answer! Its symbol lay across her very knees—the
white silk of which she was making a scarf for the general
commanding for the King in Finistère. And that general
was her husband—her husband who loved her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could a heart, not very young, break with excess of
happiness and gratitude? Spring’s joy was not like this—not
so secure, not so blest. Surely this, the joy of autumn,
was better!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes were full of tears as she looked at the golden
tranquillity before her, the still trees whence floated the
murmur of Marthe’s pigeons, the late flowers, the windless
blue sky behind the poplars. But they did not fall; and
after sitting a moment longer gazing before her she rose,
and going to the window, looked in. Marthe, alone once
more, was still seated at the harpsichord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a charming little song, my child,” said Valentine,
“and what a fresh voice you have!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mlle de la Vergne rose and, smiling, made her a curtsey.
“Chère Madame, it is a little song that Artamène unearthed
somewhere; we used to sing it when he was here in the
spring recovering of his wound, M. de Céligny and he and I.
There is another verse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you not sing it then? Sing it all again, if you will,
to please me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat down in the room this time, and once more
Marthe sang the words, to the light tripping measure of the
first stanza, and the martial rhythm of the second. For
the third, the music changed yet again to more solemn
harmonies:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>“Then, when Death batters</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>At my gate,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>One boon, I pray thee,</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Grant me, Fate—</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Instant to open</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Ere he wait!”</span></p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The chords ended in the minor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking up, Marthe saw that Mme de Trélan had leant
her head on one hand. She rose, stood a moment irresolute,
and then darted to her, and flinging herself on her
knees beside her seized her other hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame! Madame! I should not have sung the
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
last verse! You are thinking—forgive me, but I can guess—that,
when the fighting begins——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine put her arm round her. “My child, you
shame me! You have more courage than I! Have you
not given your brother to the same danger, and more than
your brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marthe hid her face on the elder woman’s shoulder, and
thus, the dark head and the golden-grey together, they were
when the door at the end of the great salon opened. Mlle
de la Vergne drew away at the sound, and both ladies
looked up. On the threshold stood the tall figure of the
Duc de Trélan, with two aides-de-camp behind him; and
the aides-de-camp were Roland and Artamène.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment the three invaders stood there, smiling, all
three of them; then the sun-barred parquet rang under
a spurred tread as Gaston came forward to kiss his wife’s
hand, and afterwards her cheek. His arm was no longer in a
sling; he was wearing the Cross of Maria Theresa. As he
lifted Marthe’s fingers to his lips she thought—though she
had never been to a court which had ceased to exist by the
time she was of an age to be presented—“One sees, just
by his manner of doing this, what a great gentleman he is.
And I wonder if, in all those brilliant ceremonies at Versailles,
in the days when he was first gentleman of the
bedchamber to the King, whether Mme de Trélan ever saw
him to such advantage as here in our drawing-room, in
that plain, dark uniform, with his sword and that air of
purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the young girl’s reflection was near enough to Valentine’s
inmost thought as, clinging to her husband’s arm,
she went with him through the long window into the sunshine
outside, which was so filled with her thoughts of him.
Out there, his arms round her, her hands on his breast, her
eyes closed, she took and gave on the lips a kiss at once
grave and passionate, a kiss like the first kiss of lovers—a
salute which had no special affinity with courts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Gaston, how I have dreamed of this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not more, my heart of hearts, than I! But I could
not well have come, had I not been leaving my headquarters
for a few days in any case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To fight? Not yet, surely?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—to talk!” said he with a little rueful look. “But
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
it will end in fighting, I trust. I am bound for the château
of La Jonchère, near Pouancé—just over the border in
Anjou—where all the chiefs are to meet on the fifteenth,
to take a final decision.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think it will be war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so. Circumstances have never been so favourable.
But you are standing all this while; let us go and
sit down in the arbour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were seated under the linden arch, as yet untouched
by autumn, when she said, “A rumour came yesterday,
Gaston, that Vendée had already risen. But we are so
out-of-the-way here; is it true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband’s face darkened. “Valentine, it is true.
Risen, and risen unsuccessfully, alas. Forestier—you may
remember hearing of him in the grande guerre—came back
from Spain to lead the rising. He was defeated and, it is
feared, mortally wounded, at Civière, on the thirtieth of
August.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine gave a little shiver. Defeat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wounds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
“Gaston, why was it? Surely in Vendée if anywhere——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My darling, Vendée is more a name than a power
now. That heroic earth is a desert; half her grown men
have perished. Three years have not nearly sufficed to
raise her from ruins. And yet”——He stopped, and
dropped his voice a little. “Yet one thing might have
done it. One thing might even have raised the bones
of the slain to life and made soldiers of them—the coming
of a Prince. It is the old cry—Charette’s cry, the cry of
Quiberon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She detected bitterness in his tone. “Does so much,
then, depend for us now, in Brittany, on the Comte d’Artois’
coming in person?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duc bent his head. “It is hard to say how much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I should not ask this, Gaston,” she suggested,
uneasy, “but does he mean to come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says so,” replied M. de Trélan gravely. “I have
no doubt he means it. It is that nest of intriguers round
him who can never be made to see the necessity. They
put it on the British Government.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine was silent, thinking of the irresponsible Prince
Charming whom they had both known personally in the
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
vanished days of Versailles; then she sighed, and changed
the topic. But after a little her husband said that it was
his duty to pay his respects to Mme de la Vergne, whom
he had not yet seen. And as he rose, reluctantly, he said,
“Could we not ride together somewhere this afternoon,
Valentine—alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was what she had been hoping for. “To the sea,
then?” she suggested. “I have not been there yet,
though you can see it from the upper windows, and hear it
too, when there is wind. Let us go there together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soit!” said he, and went off in search of the lady of
the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the salon, meanwhile, Marthe entertained the aides-de-camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you must kiss my left hand to-day, Monsieur de
Céligny,” she said, laughing, and put her right behind her
back. “I keep the other exclusively now for our
General.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had a flame-coloured ribbon in her hair, and her
eyes danced as always. Yes, she was worth all that
Mirabel unpleasantness! But Roland had already seen
her since his return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle,” he said with some audacity, “if I am
to follow M. le Duc’s example in salutation to Mme de
Trélan, after the hand comes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the cheek. But there,
too, I would be content with the left!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That also,” said Marthe with dignity, “is reserved for
someone else!” And she provokingly held it up to her
brother, who kissed her on both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I hear you singing <span class='it'>Sur le Seuil</span> just now, ma
petite?” he enquired. “That was why you never heard
us riding up. You were making such a to-do among those
low notes, for Death battering on the gate, that he really
might have been battering for all you heard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, presently, with a little wise smile, Artamène drifted
out of the salon. He went into the garden and climbed
up into an apple tree which he knew of, where he could lie
at his ease in a fork and try some of the small green apples.
“Maman and I,” he thought, “are de trop in this establishment.
M. le Marquis—his pardon, M. le Duc—and his
resuscitated spouse (who is worthy of him) in the arbour,
Roland and Marthe in the salon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Je me fais hermite.”
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But his departure had not greatly facilitated matters,
for presently Mme de la Vergne came in and carried off
Marthe on some business concerned with the nourishment
of the gentlemen who had descended on her, and a moment
or two later, when Roland stood irresolute and alone by the
window, he perceived his leader coming in search of his
hostess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and talk to Mme de Trélan, my boy,” said the Duc.
“She is in the arbour. I imagine you still have memories
of Mirabel to discuss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Roland went to the arbour, where Valentine was,
and having at her request fetched her embroidery, sat
himself down precariously at her feet on an overturned
wateringpot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, I have a grievance against M. le Duc,” he
began. “I must lay it before you, for you are the only
person who can do anything for me in the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine looked up. “What is it, my child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My locket!” said Roland. “The locket you gave
me. He has never returned it since that night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever asked him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland shook his head, and his eyes said plainly who he
proposed should perform that office. Valentine met
them—and her needle slipped. The memory of another
garden came back to her. He <span class='it'>was</span> like Gaston in just that
light, when he wore just that expression.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blood!” cried the young man. “Madame, you are
quite pale! If you would allow me——” And out came
his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head, and twisted her own round the
scratch, which had already flecked the silk of the scarf.
Suppose her first impression had been correct after all?
Well, it was part of the pain of the past, stretching onwards,
which she must face. And did it hurt so much in this
wonderful present? But her look was grave when she said
lightly, “Is there not some other person’s locket you would
prefer to the concierge’s, Roland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flushed a little. “Even if she would have me, if
Mme de la Vergne and her brother—and my grandfather—would
give their consents, I am more or less penniless,
Madame. My estates were sequestrated when my father
died two years ago.”
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>His father! Her heart leapt up again. And yet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Was it possible that she <span class='it'>wished</span> he were Gaston’s son?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sequestrated by the Government, I suppose? You
never told me that. Where are they, Roland—in Brittany
also?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Madame; right down in the south, near Avignon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quite abruptly the Duchesse de Trélan stood up, dropping
the scarf; and the youth, trying to follow her example
with the alacrity which politeness demanded, all but rolled
off the wateringcan. And Valentine apologised. “I suddenly
felt it too hot here. I will go under the trees, I
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near Avignon! So was Saint-Chamans. She really felt
faint, and yet it was not exactly with distaste. But she
must know. And since nothing, not even <span class='it'>that</span>, had power
to come between them now she would ask Gaston himself
at the first opportunity. She did not even feel that she
must have time to reflect on this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But perhaps Gaston meant to tell her of his own free
will .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she saw him and Marthe coming that way through
the sunshine, under the apple trees, and she went towards
him, followed by Roland. And in his hermitage the
Chevalier de la Vergne, making a wry face over a sour
apple, roused himself to peer down at the sound of voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything that there is of a family party!” he
observed softly. And with that, judging it time to discover
himself, he dropped down from his tree and joined the
quartet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there you are, young gentleman,” remarked M. de
Trélan. “Mademoiselle and I have been looking for you.
How far did you say it was to the sea, Mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About five miles, Monsieur le Duc.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you shall lend me your horse after déjeuner, Artamène,
and Mme de Trélan shall ride Zéphyr. He prefers
to carry a lady, does he not, Mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not vouch for that, Monsieur le Duc. He has
been more honoured since he ceased to do so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You perhaps have not had time to realise, Valentine,”
said Gaston, addressing his wife with a smile creeping round
his mouth, “that, as in Eastern countries—and not only
there, I fancy—where an accused, fearing an adverse
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>
judgment, is prompt to send a substantial present to the
judge beforehand, so Zéphyr (himself of Eastern origin)
came to me as a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bribe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and my hands, I fear,
are somewhat stained by corruption.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is that?” asked the Duchesse, glancing from her
husband to the laughing girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my lips, by the same token, are sealed,” finished
M. de Trélan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mesdames, Messieurs, le déjeuner est servi,” announced
the recently promoted Séraphin, approaching with the
gait of a rustic and the livery of a major-domo.
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span></p>

<h2 id='b4c2'>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE YELLOW POPPY</h3>

<p class='noindent'>So Gaston and Valentine rode alone to the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went at first through deep lanes, scarcely wide
enough to ride abreast, where they lost sight of their goal,
then, mounting a rise of sandy turf, came on it spread
gloriously before them. A fresh breeze was blowing off
the land, and the water was of a hundred vivid, changing
hues—the clearest green, purple that was almost rose, and
blue that was more than the blue of heaven. It was
flecked with myriad little tips of foam that looked like sea-birds,
for ever vanishing and reappearing, and the offshore
wind ran over it in sudden violent caresses. Far out, it
was the colour of a distant wood of hyacinths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They checked their horses. Valentine drew a long
breath before the pulsating wonder of it, the freedom and
the joy. She stretched out her hand in silence to her
husband, and he took it as simply; so they sat on their
horses hand in hand like two children at their first sight of
the ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he suggested their going down to the shore, and they
went down among the shelving dunes, their horses’ hoofs
sinking deep in the loose blown sand. At the verge were
the stem and ribs of an abandoned boat, conveniently
embedded there, to which they could tether their horses,
and Gaston, dismounting, did so and held out his arms to
her. But Zéphyr whinnied after them; sand and rotting
timbers pleased him not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down here, on the shore itself, the sandhills gave some
shelter, and they could walk in comfort, especially when
they went nearer to the water where the sand was firm
and ribbed. Despite the offshore wind, the curling waves
shook off from their edges a breeze of their own, the
essence of the sea. Clinging to her husband’s arm, Valentine
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>
leant her head against his shoulder and half closed her
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” he said softly, looking down at her, “here
one forgets wars and anxieties, the past and the future—everything
but the present. We were right to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breeze of the sea’s own seemed to freshen. Down
here one could not see in the same way as from the verge
above the whole extent of that moving field of rapture, all
the rainbow thoughts that ran over its surface, but one
was nearer to its incommunicable magic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be cold, my darling. Let us walk along by
the waves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little seas, tumbling in foam at their feet, bending in
mock homage before them, racing slily to entrap them,
laughed their undying laugh whose meaning the heart of
man is not deep enough to seize. Starfish, fluted shells,
trails of seaweed, all their careless treasures were displayed
there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They would laugh with just the same fresh joy
to-morrow .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when Gaston would be here no longer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
O, terrible, that eternal youth and indifference!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston,” she said, gripping his arm more closely, “you
are not going alone to La Jonchère, surely? You spoke of
sending the young men back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my heart,” said he, putting his hand over hers.
“I am not going alone. M. du Ménars and another officer
will meet me to-morrow on the road, with an escort as well.
When we meet I shall send my aides-de-camp back to the
Clos-aux-Grives. That was all I meant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few paces more, and he added, “Unless I take one of
them with me to La Jonchère in order to use him as a
messenger to you. Which of them, in that case, would
you rather have as Mercury?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why did he ask her that? She forgot the sea and
glanced at him, but he was looking at the waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She answered as she would have answered in any case.
“I would rather have Roland. He is a charming boy
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was already fond of him at Mirabel.” If Gaston
meant to tell her without being asked, which was her great
hope, she would make it as easy as possible for him. She
paused, and went on lightly, “Mme de la Vergne, however,
might prefer her own son. As for Marthe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well,
I know Roland’s mind at least on that matter.”
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband stopped in his walk. “Valentine,” he
said, turning his head towards her, “I have something to
tell you about Roland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped too, and loosed his arm. For a moment
her heart seemed to pause also. He had paled a little,
his voice was very grave and not free from difficulty, but
he did not try to escape her gaze. On the contrary he
looked straight at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“<span class='it'>I have something to tell you about Roland!</span>” echoed the
waves, laughing.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Valentine de Trélan knew that she wanted
to spare him the explicit avowal, because she saw how much
it would cost him to utter to her face what was, by implication,
an insult to her—though an insult twenty years old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guessed it, Gaston,” she said, very quietly. “But
I hoped that you would tell me. It is right that I should
know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I want to learn nothing further .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
only wished it not to lie, unspoken, between us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now
we need never speak of it again, save as it affects the boy
himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate that you should know it,” he said with emotion.
“And yet I hated even more to keep you in ignorance.
I thought, too, that you might guess, and that was worse
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Valentine, Valentine, I cannot wish it undone, because
I love him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but if only I need not have given you this
pain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he was suffering more than she; she knew that.
Once again, as in the arbour this morning, it came to her
as strange that she should feel it so little. And, only
eager for the moment to allay the deep distress in his eyes
and voice, she put her hands on his arm. “It does not
pain me now, Gaston. No, no, believe me! I am speaking
the truth! It is so long ago, in that other life which we
have forgotten. Why remember it now, in this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught her hands and raised them to his lips.
“Generous! generous!” he murmured. “Why must I
choose to-day to wound you so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you have chosen the right day, the right place!”
she cried. The vanishing of the dread that he might not
tell her had almost irradiated her. “The .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the past—see,
it can be forgotten, as a pebble would be, cast into
those great waters .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that there is no pain
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>
now—<span class='it'>I</span> love him, too. Will not that convince you, my
husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it did. He bowed his forehead silently upon her
hands as he held them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But as for guessing,” she went on, “—O Gaston, my
very dear, it is over now—as for guessing, the first moment
that I saw him, lying in the garden at Mirabel, I was
startled .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I thought it was imagination. And I
grew so fond of him in those few days, innocent and gallant
as he was. Yet I put the idea away at once because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
because he had not your eyes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and now, after all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
She stopped; speech was suddenly failing her. “O Gaston,”
she said in a breaking whisper, “Gaston, if only he had <span class='it'>mine</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And pulling her hands away she put them before her
own face, weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My darling, my darling!” he cried, and strained her
in his arms, saying no more than that, beyond speech
indeed himself, pierced once more by the memory of his
own words at their parting, which came back even now to
stab him. But as, with her face covered, she wept upon
his heart, he knew that it was not of his unworthy reproach
that she was thinking. Hers was a deeper and more
mysterious pain. It seemed so to throb through her as
he held her, there on the sandy shore, that the very waves
were full of it; and he could do nothing save hold her
more tenderly still, and kiss the yet beautiful hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a little she ceased to sob, and dried her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only one thing more,” she said unsteadily. “Does
Roland know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gave my word to his grandfather that I would not
tell him before he was one-and-twenty. I have tried to
keep it in the spirit as well as in the letter. I do not think
he guesses. What others may guess I do not know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is plain,” said Valentine, “that he worships you.
But they all do that, those young men—and with reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were still standing at the edge of the waves when
she put the seal on her forgiveness. For she said, looking
at him with her clear eyes, “Gaston, when I see him and
speak with him I am glad that he is your son!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Later on they sat at the base of the sandhills, and
spoke of many things—even of M. de Brencourt, so sore a
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>
subject to her husband that, till now, Valentine had scarcely
dared to mention the Comte’s name. Particularly had this
been the case since he had learnt, at the Clos-aux-Grives,
of the lie told at Mirabel about his own death. Most of
the tale of treachery Valentine had gleaned, not from
Gaston at all, but from the Abbé Chassin. Yet it seemed
to her a better thing that Gaston should say openly now,
as with cold passion he did, “<span class='it'>He took my hand after I had
gone out with him, and yet went on with the worst treason of
all! It is impossible for a man to forgive an act so absolutely
base!</span>” than that he should nurse his just resentment in
secret and never speak of it. But though through the
Comte de Brencourt she had so nearly lost him before ever
he was found, though now, realising it afresh, she caught
to her breast the arm which the false comrade had pierced,
this day and place seemed to spread healing hands even
over that madness and treachery. And when she looked
at him, holding him thus, the frown went from Gaston’s
brow, and adding, “At least, then, I will try to forget,”
he gave her a long kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But soon, too soon, it was time to return. The wind
was dropping; the gulls which had been soaring high
on its strength were now beginning to ride on the little
waves, or to stalk along by the edge of the tide. The brief
hour was over, the hour that seemed more particularly set
between the old life and the new, in this place of wild air
and rapture, where the years of pain and surmise were forgotten,
and the hazard of the sword and what the future
might bring yet unweighed. It was time to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as, very close together, the two went slowly along
the dry sand at the bottom of the dunes, they saw at a
little distance a small patch of colour there—a pool of faint
green, touched with blots of pale, swaying yellow that
caught and held the sunlight. They came to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flowers even here!” exclaimed Valentine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the bride of the waves, the beautiful yellow sea-poppy,
that blossoms so late, and is so soon scattered.
They both stood and looked down at it, not without wonder,
as those who come on a jewel in a dusty place—at the
strong, abundant, deeply-cut foliage, silvery green in the
sunset, fashioned to defy wind and wave, that had yet
given birth to such an ethereal marvel of a flower, whose
<span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>
every petal was a miracle of delicacy, a flower so frail that
a breath could put out its cup of light. Already the plant
at their feet bore the tokens of the passing of many of its
blossoms, in the long curving horns, treasures of next year’s
promise, which had succeeded the fallen petals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine, who had never seen the horned poppy before,
knelt down by it. “How wonderful to bloom so late, and
in so inclement a place!” she said. “Look how the wind
beats on these flowers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet they do not fall,” said her husband. “You
shall give me one, my dearest heart, for this our second
betrothal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she plucked a poppy and held it up to him. It seemed
almost to have light in itself, like a fragile golden lamp half
enclosed between the open, guarding hands of its leaves.
He took it, and bending, kissed the hand that gave it him.
Next moment, either because it was caught by a puff of
wind, or because its brief life was already over, he held
nothing in his hand but the stem with its sturdy foliage,
and the pistil set within its fringe of orange-yellow stamens.
The four lovely shining petals were blown away. One only
rested over his heart, caught there on the cross of white and
gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine turned pale. What had suggested to her
that this wonder was like their love, so late in blossoming,
so little favoured in its surroundings, so exquisite .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and,
perhaps, so short-lived?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, and I will give you another,” she said with a
rather forced gaiety. “I will choose a younger flower
this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” cried Gaston de Trélan. “I want no
other.” And, gently taking off the bright, clinging thing
from his breast and closing it in his hand, he stooped
and recovered the other three—two from the sand, the
fourth from Valentine’s habit, and lifted them to his lips.
At the base of each pale golden petal was the faintest stain.
Then he put them carefully, almost reverently away in a
little leather case, and replaced it inside his uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look quite white, my darling!” he exclaimed,
catching sight of her face as she rose. “What is the
matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she would not tell him; she only came for the last
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>
time in that place into the strong circle of his arms. Her
cheek rested where the poppy petal had lain, on the guerdon
of valour; against her side she felt the hilt of his sword—a
sweet discomfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Gaston, my heart, my only love! It was worth those
years—this hour! Only, with so much happiness upon
me, I think I would rather die to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you afraid?” he asked in a low voice, holding her
as if he meant to hold her for ever. “Are you afraid, my
saint, my strong saint? I am not. This place that we
have come to, after such bitter wanderings, shall hold us
always now—be sure of it—in life or death!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And though the yellow poppy shone and shivered at
their feet—the sea-poppy that flowers so late and is so
soon scattered—she knew that it was true.
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span></p>

<h2 id='b4c3'>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE COST OF ANSWERED PRAYER</h3>

<p class='noindent'>So it was Roland, now openly betrothed to Marthe, who
came to La Vergne a week later, bringing Gaston’s letter
announcing that the die was cast, and it was Roland who
told Valentine more fully of the great gathering of Royalist
chiefs at La Jonchère, surrounded by almost inaccessible
forest, and guarded by more than a thousand peasants.
The young man, though not himself admitted to the conferences,
had seen some of the leaders, Châtillon and
Bourmont and La Prévalaye and Sol de Grisolles, and
d’Autichamp the Vendean, and Georges Cadoudal whom
he had missed at Hennebont. Their three days of deliberation
had resulted in a decision for a general levy of arms
in the West. The date fixed was the fifteenth of October.
“Not very long to wait, Madame!” said Hermes enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, for Gaston’s wife the time was all too short till the
clash of arms,—but all too long till his promised visit.
For in his letter he had said that before the hour of action
broke he should, please God, come and show her all that
was in his heart for her. And Valentine looked at the words
every day, as September, full of rumours, ripened towards
October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first week in October came the news that fighting
had already begun in Northern Brittany, and with success,
for the Chevalier de la Nougarède, “Achille le brun,” had
hardly got back from La Jonchère than he raised the
standard, and beat, at Argentré, the Republican general
Schildt who had come out of Rennes to attack him. And
even before that d’Andigné, the Comte de Châtillon’s very
competent chief of staff, had inflicted a severe little defeat
at Noyant on eight hundred of the old, tried soldiers who
had formed part of the garrison of Milan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand there was bad news from Holland,
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>
where Brune had defeated the allied Anglo-Russian forces
of the Texel expedition on September 19; and worse from
Switzerland, where, six days later, Masséna inflicted such
a severe defeat on Korsakoff at Zurich that Suwaroff, coming
from Italy to join his countryman, had difficulty in
saving his own army. Valentine was uneasy at these
tidings of the Republic’s triumph on a large scale, but
neither she nor the other two women fully comprehended
how they isolated the Royalists of the West. And though
she wondered why the forty-five thousand English and
Russians could not have been landed directly on the soil
of France, in Brittany or Vendée, instead of in Holland,
she could not foresee that a little later Brune’s whole army,
set free by the capitulation of Alkmaar, would be employed
against the Chouans. She worked at the last golden
fleur-de-lys on Gaston’s scarf, and helped Mme de la Vergne
and Marthe in their household employments and in the
orchard, for there were fewer men than ever, Séraphin
and two of the farm boys having gone to join the Lilies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And once or twice, in that St. Luke’s summer come before
its time, she found her steps turning towards the sea.
She went there twice with Marthe. She would have liked
to go there again with Gaston, but she knew that desire
unlikely of fulfilment. And the sea was so changed—calm
with an unearthly calm; shining with a pure, still radiance,
and warded by great slow-moving fleets of cloud galleons
like mother-of-pearl, that were reflected, far-gleaming, in
the water over which they sailed. Yes, this October sea
was as far removed from a tranquil blue sea of summer
as from that beautiful September sea, where there had
been wind and rainbow shadows—and the yellow poppy,
which bloomed no longer. There shone instead the
golden leaves of the poplars at La Vergne, incredibly yellow
against the distant sea, on the one or two days that the
sea had colour. But mostly it was of that indescribable
hue of nacre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when would Gaston come?</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he did come Valentine would have given everything
in the world that he had not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Colette, the cook, who had gone to the tiny village
for her marketing, came back on one of these still mornings
rather flustered, reporting that there were soldiers there. It
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>
was a most startling as well as a most unpleasant novelty.
In none of the previous risings had Blues ever been seen
at La Vergne. The ancient woman at first reported the
invaders to be about a hundred; later she came down to a
dozen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But half that number could terrorise the place. And
why were they there? The three ladies at the château
had nothing to hide—as yet, nothing, for themselves, to
fear; nevertheless they were in a fever. If word could
only be sent to the “Marquis de Kersaint” in case he were
on his road! But word could not be sent. Valentine comforted
herself and them by the assurance that he would not
come without an escort, and would therefore have nothing
to fear from a handful of Blues. He would never come
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that was precisely what her husband did, riding in
quietly to the stable-yard at dusk of that October day,
and, finding no one there, putting up his horse with his
own hands. And Marthe, hearing unwonted sounds, ran
out from the kitchen and found him in the act, with Zéphyr
very much at home, and pulling down hay from his old rack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, Monsieur le Duc! Monsieur le Duc!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle,” said Gaston, laughing, “I do indeed
apologise for making free of your provender without permission.
May I plead that it is for your own horse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She darted at him while Zéphyr whinnied for recognition.
“Why did you choose to-day to come, Monsieur de Trélan?
We have been so praying that you would not. Do not say
that you are alone, unescorted! For .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did you not
know it? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there are soldiers in the village!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s silence. “No, I did not know it,”
said the Duc quietly. “Had I known, I should not have
come alone. But I did not enter the village, so they
will not have seen me.” He paused, passing his hand
once or twice over Zéphyr’s neck, and said in a voice which,
despite himself, revealed how intensely he disliked the
idea, “I do not wish to involve you in unpleasantness.
Perhaps the simplest thing would be to ride away again at
once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marthe shook her head. Now that he was here, risk or
no risk, he must see his wife. Perhaps indeed there was
greater risk in going back.
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must stay,” she said. “And we have taken certain
precautions. Come to the house, Monsieur le Duc,
and I will show you, even before you see Mme de Trélan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Zéphyr—if they should search? He becomes
your horse once more, I suppose? But my saddle,
Mademoiselle, what of that? Unless you can persuade
them that you always use a man’s!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is mine quite near,” she said, pointing to it, “and
it fits him, of course. Yours—it has holsters, too!—we
must hide in the loft.” They hid it, and in a few minutes
she was showing M. de Trélan the old hiding-place in the
dining-room. “It is very ingenious, the way one gets
there,” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It <span class='it'>was</span> very ingenious. Against the painted panels
stood a massive sideboard which four men could scarcely
have stirred from its place. But when Marthe touched a
spring a section of it turned upon itself and gave access
to a tiny room behind, whose door formed part of the
panelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very charming little retreat,” observed the Duc,
smiling. “But I hope that you do not expect me to
deprive myself of your society, Mademoiselle, by spending
all my time in there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We should be the last to wish to banish you, Monsieur.
But there it is ready, if you—get tired of us! Yet I think
you have run all the risk you are likely to run .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless
they <span class='it'>know</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, I think, is impossible,” said Gaston. And then
Valentine, attracted by voices, entered. Marthe slipped
out with the speed of a swallow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O my darling, my darling, why have you come?” was
her first word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ma foi,” returned her husband gaily, as he kissed her,
“apparently to be put aside, like the bread, in that sort of
garde-manger there—at least that is the fate Mlle Marthe
designs for me. It is not my intention, however.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston, you should not have come!” she repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chère amie, what a greeting. Shall I go again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” She clung to his arm. “You did not
know, of course!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said more gravely, “I did not know. It would
not have been right for me to come if I had known.” Then
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
he looked at her and said with deliberation, “I am only
thankful that I did not know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had all of them that in the blood which responds
to the stimulus of danger, and supper, in the room whence
the hiding-place was so easily accessible, was a cheerful
meal. During its course news arrived that the soldiers
had left the village altogether. So they went with light
hearts into the salon, and there the leader of Finistère told
the three ladies what in a few days they would divine for
themselves, the outline of the main plan of campaign, and
why what seemed the hazardous plan of attacking large
towns instead of small was the better. For in the small
towns, violently anti-royalist as they were, the whole
population was armed, and the walls and palisades loopholed,
so that the losses involved in the capture of such positions,
without artillery, would be too heavy to be worth incurring.
On the other hand the large towns were often insufficiently
garrisoned for their size, opinion therein was more moderate,
sometimes secretly favourable, and even an unsuccessful
attack would benefit the Royalists, since it would draw off
the Republican troops from the country districts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a good thing that we are going to begin fighting
in earnest,” he concluded, “for soon I shall not be able to
hold in my followers. Do you know what Lucien and
Roland did the other day for a wager—strolled, in full
uniform, through the streets of Lanvennec in broad daylight!
The Republicans were just changing guard, and
were, I fancy, too much petrified by their audacity to take
in what was happening. Anyhow my young sparks had
completed their promenade before the chase began. It was
<span class='it'>I</span> who had them arrested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had barely finished the story when steps came flying
down the passage, the door was unceremoniously opened,
and Marthe’s maid, shutting it behind her, stood there
panting. “Soldiers!” she gasped, “they are in the
house .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some in the garden .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they are coming here
now.” Indeed, through the closed door could clearly be
heard approaching feet and the clank of spurs—feet that
cut off the possibility of swift retreat to the cachette in the
dining-room. In another moment their owners would be
in the salon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine, turning quite white, went to her husband’s
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
side, and Gaston, who had jumped up, looked quickly
round the room. “The window,” he suggested; but at
the same moment came a blow on the shutters outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” exclaimed Marthe, as pale as Mme de Trélan.
“Behind you—the hangings!” And she all but pushed
him to the wall, parted the hangings of woven Indian
stuff, and with her little hands drew them hastily over
him again. Then she ran to the long window, on which
repeated blows were raining. Mme de la Vergne, nervous
but collected, went to the door. And Valentine was
left by the hearth to see that Marthe’s work was not
completed. For under the thin gay riot of branches, birds
and flowers that concealed him, were only too plainly visible
Gaston’s boots—the hangings did not quite reach the
floor. It seemed to her that in that second she knew the
concentrated anguish of a lifetime—for Marthe’s quick
wit had been right; it was the only possible place in the
room. Yet she had seized a brocaded cushion from the
sofa, had cast it down against the hangings on her husband’s
feet as though it had fallen there, and, placing a low chair
in front of it, had herself sat down as a living screen, all
before the door actually opened and the Republican officer
and his men came in.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>If the search had been anything but perfunctory, Gaston
de Trélan must have been discovered. But the officer,
it was obvious, had no idea whom the Château de la Vergne
was harbouring, nor indeed, that it was specifically harbouring
anybody, and he was almost apologetic at disturbing
the ladies. But—orders were orders. Round the salon,
therefore, he merely took a long glance, and when they had
searched the rest of the house with about the same particularity,
the Blues went away, and the inmates of the
château could sleep in perfect security.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But not Valentine. For all her courage and resource she
came near breaking down when she was at last alone with
her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel as if I should never sleep again!” she said,
pressing the palms of her hands over her eyes. “I see
nothing but those men’s faces and the way they looked
round the room. Gaston, Gaston, I am not fit to be your
wife!”
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never would I have come,” said he remorsefully,
holding her in his arms as they stood by the hearth in her
room, “never would I have come had I known it would
be to put you to such strain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston, is it true that the Royalists have no artillery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he replied unwillingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And these Republican victories in Holland and Switzerland—are
they not very unfortunate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not fortunate, certainly. But the greater
the odds, the greater the glory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston, I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do not think I can let you go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this he said nothing, but very tenderly kissed her
hair, as he held her. And now she began to see the price
that every woman pays who stands where she did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” she said, after a pause, “I think I must be,
ordinarily, without imagination. I think of you and
danger always, every moment that I breathe, but they never
seem together, and only to-night, when danger was in the
room with you and I sat there pretending to sew—thank
God it was not your scarf that I had—thinking every
moment that one of them would pick up that cushion and
you would be dragged out—it was only then that I realised
what danger is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all night she realised it, and all night, whether she
woke, or slept in snatches, she saw the price that she must
pay, although he was safe for the moment at her side.
Gaston, too, lay long awake, and they talked; but he must
rise and ride away before sunrise, and, campaigning having
given him the gift of sleep at will, after a while he slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could sleep, yes; for though reluctant to leave her
he was going to what he desired, to what she—strange
irony—had prayed, years ago, that he might desire—a
man’s work, a man’s hazards, a man’s endurances. Long
unanswered, that slow prayer of hers had found ample
fulfilment now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and she was beginning to learn the
cost of its realisation. His hand held at last the hilt of a
blade that was worthy of him—but its point was in her
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once in her torment she slipped out of bed and wandered
distractedly round the dark room. She went, without
conscious purpose, towards the deep recessed window, and,
feeling her way to the curtains, met on the window-seat
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>
something long and hard and cold. Her fingers told her
that it was Gaston’s sword, which he had laid there.
And, hating it and loving it at once, she knelt down and
laid her forehead against the scabbard. “Bring him
back to me! bring him back!” But what could a sword
do against a bullet?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine looked out. The night had been dull and
cloudy, but it was now getting towards dawn. She had
a desire to see Gaston more clearly, and, leaving the curtain
half drawn, she went back towards the bed. Then she
wished she had left the window veiled. In that grey light
how pale he looked, lying there motionless in the ancient
bed, whose twisted posts recalled the great candlesticks
she had set out at Mirabel for the requiem mass that was
never said. Ah, what horrible presentiments seized one
in this wan, uncourageous hour! She had a yearning to
wake him, to hear him speak; she even pressed her hand
over her mouth as she stood there by him lest she should do
it, but all the time she knew that an impulse such as that
had no chance against the deep, protective instinct which
immediately overrode it. He must sleep, because he
would have need of strength to-day whither he went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cold and heartsick, she crept back at last into bed and
lay there, still wakeful, in agony. How often in the
weeks of tension that were coming would she not lie and
crave for the pain that she had now—the anticipated
pain of parting. For a little time longer she could listen
to his quiet breathing. To have done that to-morrow and
the morrow after would be the whole of bliss, for she
would have known that he was safe. But to-morrow
night——</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did fall asleep in the end. A slight sound woke her.
Gaston, fully dressed, was kneeling by her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, my heart, is it time already?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wants five minutes, beloved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that black night Valentine had determined that,
if it killed her, she would not fail him at the moment of
parting. “I must get up, then, and give you your scarf,”
she said, raising herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must fasten it on for me,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Gaston, not over your uniform—and you without
an escort! It is too conspicuous .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wish now that I
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>
had not worked the ends in gold. No; hide it in your
breast, and put it on when you are back!” She had
slipped out of bed, had found the symbol, and was holding
it close to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, most dear,” said he, smiling. “I wanted
your fingers to knot it round me, but perhaps you are
right. It is from your hands that I receive it, which is
all that matters.” He knelt and took it from her, kissed
the folded silk, and opening the breast of his uniform,
put it over his heart. She stooped over him suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not worthy of you, my dearest, for last night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
if I could have kept you back, I would. This morning I
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I desire you to go. But I am weak, Gaston; only
promise me that you will think of me as I wish to be in this,
and not as I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as I am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still kneeling, he caught her hands. “Have you then
so little knowledge of what you are to me, Valentine—you,
my star, my standard with the Lilies, my oriflamme itself!”
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span></p>

<h2 id='b4c4'>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>WAR .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. AND TREATIES</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>And now at last the West was really ablaze, and in a few
days, as department after department lit up with the carefully
prepared flame, the Republicans began to suffer more
serious reverses than they had known since the days of
the <span class='it'>grande guerre</span>, the Vendée proper, six years before.
For the Chouannerie which the dying Directory had to face
was very different from what it had been in the days of
Hoche and the Convention; it was no longer a swarm of
small peasant uprisings led, sometimes, by nameless chiefs
as uneducated as the men who followed them. The leaders
of this war were gentlemen, returned émigrés, with enrolled
levies at their disposal; with a system of requisition, a
network of espionage and intelligence throughout the
country districts; with, here and there, white-plumed
staff officers wearing the cross of St. Louis, with uniforms,
now and then with fifes and drums, and even, in one or
two cases, with a little cavalry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And their tactics were new and more formidable. No
longer did they content themselves with overrunning the
country districts, avoiding the neighbourhood of towns;
on the contrary, as M. de Kersaint had told the ladies of
La Vergne, they were in such force that they threatened—and
did more than threaten—those centres of Republicanism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the voice of Cadoudal the country between Vannes
and Auray had risen as one man. Not vainly had he
boasted in the spring of his careful organisation. And
while he himself successively took Landévant between
Auray and Hennebont, Port Navalo at the outlet of the
inland sea of the Morbihan, and other places between that
and the mouth of the Vilaine, his lieutenant Sol de Grisolles
raised the districts between the mouth of the Vilaine and
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>
that of the Loire. To him fell La Roche-Bernard on the
river itself, Pontchâteau and Guérande with its mediæval
walls and towers, a formidable triangle of possessions above
St. Nazaire and the Loire mouth. And these were only
some of the Republican losses in Brittany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maine fought under the young Comte de Bourmont,
seconded by the veteran Chevalier de Tercier, and Chappedelaine,
and the Chevalier de Châteauneuf—who was
“Achille le blond.” Another of Bourmont’s lieutenants,
La Fregeolière, pushed as far as Le Lude and La Flèche
on the borders of the Angoumois and Touraine. Anjou
obeyed the old Comte de Châtillon, and, after the brilliant
initial success of his chief of staff, d’Andigné, at Noyant in
September, the Angevins made rapid incursions into the
districts of Segré, Candé and Châteauneuf. Ingrandes,
Varades on the Loire, garrisoned towns, were threatened.
From the Loire right up to the Côtes-du-Nord the Republican
cantonments and posts were submerged under a flood
of insurgents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But far more resounding than all these widespread successes
were the audacious <span class='it'>coups de main</span> carried out on
large towns. St. Brieuc on its bay in the Côtes-du-Nord
was not, it is true, a large town, but it was garrisoned;
yet Mercier, Cadoudal’s young alter ego, and Saint-Régent
took and held it for a night while General Casabianca
barricaded himself in his hotel. The Chouans set free
three hundred Royalists imprisoned there, and took
muskets. But, ten days before this, a much more daring
capture had been made—nothing less than the city of Le
Mans which, at three o’clock on the morning of October 15,
Bourmont’s forces entered at five points simultaneously.
He held it for three days before he withdrew. Even more
than Le Mans, Nantes, that great city, proud of its resistance
to the Vendean army, might have seemed secure.
But while Grigny, commanding there, went out in the
wrong direction to encounter the Angevins, Châtillon and
d’Andigné, under cover of a thick fog, slipped in at four
o’clock in the morning of October 20 with no more than two
thousand followers, of whom only half were accustomed to
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The taking of Nantes, though the place had to be evacuated
before daylight, and though it did not give the
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
captors any material advantage in the way of arms and
powder, as did the seizure of Le Mans, had, equally with
that exploit, exactly the effect on public opinion that the
Royalists had hoped, creating such a terror in the large
towns that they could not be left without adequate garrisons,
and thus immobilising a number of Republican troops,
and leaving the country districts freer for the operations
of the Royalists. Before either of these feats, however,
the example had been set in Finistère—and was not Valentine
proud of it?—when her husband, with a smaller force
than any, seized and held for two days and nights the
pleasant cathedral city of Quimper, the <span class='it'>chef-lieu</span> of the
department. Yet she could hardly have been prouder
than ‘les jeunes,’ who played a most conspicuous part in
the enterprise. To the Republicans of Quimper the
sudden inroad of a hitherto unknown phenomenon, Chouan
cavalry—not very wonderfully mounted, it is true, nor
smartly equipped, but making a terrific noise on the cobbled
streets—was little short of apocalyptic. The Chevalier
de la Vergne, the commander of this small body, observed
to his two intimates that they had a right to give themselves
airs, since the capture of Quimper was undoubtedly
due in the main to “Charlemagne’s Horse,” as he had
christened his corps; but Roland reminded him that,
if such were the case, it was really Mirabel which had
taken the town, for Mirabel had mounted and armed those
cavaliers, as it had armed the greater part of M. de Kersaint’s
<span class='it'>gars</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, after leaving Quimper, before the troops sent in
haste from the Morbihan could fall upon him, the Marquis
de Kersaint was up threatening Châteaulin, while M. du
Ménars with “Charlemagne’s Horse” marched rapidly
towards Carhaix. A force was then ordered out of Brest
in the hopes of catching the Royalists between two fires,
but, nobody knew how, M. de Kersaint and his men slipped
through, and, effecting a junction with his subordinate,
plunged into the wild, broken country round Huelgoat,
where the Blues did not dare to follow them. Finally,
in retiring unsatisfied to Brest, the Republicans were fallen
upon in the rear by a perfectly unexpected body of Chouans
from the north, which they had believed quiet. Their
leader was one “Sincère.” And the authorities, completely
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>
misinformed as they had been about the supposed
quiescence of Finistère, were at their wits’ end to know
where the flame would next break out in the department.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But south of the Loire things did not go so well. There
were no great generals left there; the majority even of the
former officers were missing. Forestier, the most popular,
was still recovering from his terrible wound of August,
and his ill-success then made a new levy still more difficult.
Yet d’Autichamp, Suzannet, and Grignon, who divided
the three Vendean commands, did their best. The Republicans
had few forces on the left bank of the Loire, and
one brilliant success might have raised Vendée from ruins.
The success did not come. Suzannet attacked Montaigu,
was beaten off and severely wounded, a misfortune which
led directly to the dispersal of his men. D’Autichamp,
who had got together a rather larger force, fell in at Les
Aubiers with two hundred and fifty Blues whose commander
stationed some of them in the church tower, whence
they killed and wounded some forty Royalists. It was
proposed to burn them out, but this would have offended
the religious scruples of the Vendeans, and they were
besieged instead. After twenty-four hours without food
or water they were still holding out. Meanwhile the
Republican <span class='it'>chef de brigade</span> at Bressuire was on the march.
D’Autichamp went to Nueil to defend the passage of the
little river Argenton against him, left the command there
to a peasant subordinate, and returned to Les Aubiers. He
had better have stayed at Nueil. The Vendeans, according
to their incorrigible habit, neglected to put sentries, the
Blues from Bressuire surprised them, and they were put to
flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The affair did not cost many men, but it had a most
unfortunate moral effect. Five thousand Vendeans had
allowed themselves to be surprised and routed by eight
hundred Blues. “Where is Cathelineau?” was the
universal cry. And in fact this miserable affray of Les
Aubiers decided the fate of the whole campaign in Vendée,
for after it d’Autichamp could only skirmish, and Grignon,
in the centre, was never able to get together many men.
Much, certainly, had hung on the valour of the Blues
in the church tower and the religious scruples of their
opponents.
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But the failure of Vendée and the startling successes in
Brittany alike paled before a much greater event. On the
9th of October, the very day that Gaston de Trélan had
ridden away alone from La Vergne at sunrise, General Bonaparte,
abandoning his army in Egypt, landed at Fréjus.
On the 16th, the day after the taking of Le Mans, he was at
Paris. In a month from the date of his landing, the
9th of November, the Directory lay in the dust, and he
was acclaimed First Consul of the temporary Consulate,
and the saviour of France. Across the path of the Bourbons
there no longer sprawled a hydra-headed incompetence.
One man of genius, with a vehement, implacable will stood
there, armed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road to power had been made easy for him. France
was only crying out for a deliverer to raise her from the
state of mud and blood in which she lay. Attempts had
already been made to find one in Joubert or Moreau. It
was conceivable that even had a Bourbon appeared he
might very well have been accepted. But it was too late
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet this moment was the very apogee of the Royalist
revival in the West. Never had they been better organised,
better recognised as a military force. What they had taken
or threatened in three weeks was amazing. In the Morbihan
they were entirely masters of the countryside; in Ille-et-Vilaine
they had strong detachments near Rennes, Fougères,
and Vitré; Bourmont in Maine occupied the bourgs and
even the little towns on the banks of the Sarthe and the
Loire; and distant Finistère had become almost volcanic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On account of these very successes, overtures of peace
had already been made, from the side of the Directory,
before the great change of Brumaire. With them was
charged the Republican general-in-chief in the West, the
Comte de Hédouville, a gentleman with the manners and
predilections of his caste, and he, in his headquarters at
Angers, was actually in conference with the chosen go-between—a
Royalist lady, Mme Turpin de Crissé—on the
day of the <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> itself, so that his success was announced
to a Government already overthrown. For he
naturally directed his powers of conciliation towards the
least victorious wing of the Royalist forces. It was with
aversion and amazement, therefore, that the leaders of
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
Brittany, Maine and Anjou heard that an armistice had
been signed on November 25 for the left bank of the Loire.
And during the cessation of hostilities the Comte de Grignon
was surprised and killed by the Republicans, so that since
d’Autichamp, who had always opposed the taking up of
arms, was more than willing, and Suzannet was <span class='it'>hors de
combat</span>, there remained no obstacle to the pacification of
Vendée. A conference for that object was imminent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a suspension of arms on the left bank of the Loire
almost of necessity brought about one on the right also,
whether the leaders were anxious for it or no. Châtillon
indeed was of the former for he was old and ill. But
Cadoudal and Mercier received it with great disfavour.
Yet, whether it were to result in peace or no, the armistice
for the purpose of treating of pacification was promulgated
on December 9, and Pouancé in Anjou was appointed as
the place of meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquis de Kersaint, away in unvanquished
Finistère, was too bitterly disgusted to attend these conferences
in person. But, unless he wished to lose touch
with the other leaders, he was obliged to be represented
there, and he sent to Pouancé two delegates, his chief of
staff, the Chevalier du Ménars, and the Abbé Chassin.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>From the Abbé Chassin’s Diary.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Pouancé, Christmas Eve, 1799.</span>—A good occasion for
reviewing, before I say my first Mass of the feast, these
brief notes that I have been keeping since M. du Ménars and
I came here a fortnight ago. Yet really all that I can say
is that we are still here, discussing, discussing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
energy expended on these conferences might have launched
a battle or a siege. Perhaps in its way it is as usefully
spent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party for continuing the war is in a minority, that
is clear. But it is a very strong minority—Cadoudal, our
mainstay here, Mercier, the Comte de Bourmont, one or
two minor chiefs, and, of course, through our voices, the
“Marquis de Kersaint.” That the Vendean leaders cry
for peace one cannot wonder, for Vendée is exhausted.
They say they have not even enough munitions for a headquarters
guard. But the war minority would more than
<span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span>
once have liked to break off the conferences, and it was
only after stormy discussions that M. de Bourmont was
named as delegate to Hédouville at Angers. He has others
with him now. I have hardly dared inform Gaston how
things were tending, though I was sent here for that purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is this to be said, that we began with a moral
victory, since we obtained that the Government should
send no more troops into the West during the armistice.
And our military position—except in Vendée—is so good
that we have every right to hope to gain our points.
Moreover the acts of the new Government, particularly the
abrogation of the abominable Law of Hostages, have disposed
many minds towards conciliation. Some of the
more warlike leaders, even, are not opposed to a respite,
provided that they can remain in arms, as they are doing.
And then there is this widespread idea among them that
Bonaparte intends to play the part of a Monk, and use his
power for a restoration of royalty. I must confess I do not
share it, but M. du Ménars does. At any rate time to penetrate
the First Consul’s intentions is no loss—we sent the
Chevalier d’Andigné to Paris on December 18 to sound him.
Moreover we want to be certain of Monseigneur le Comte
d’Artois’ wishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So time is really what we are playing for in these negotiations
with Hédouville. The worst of it is that Hédouville
is so accommodating that he makes this difficult! All our
just demands are on the way to being accepted—complete
freedom for religion, no oath or formal submission, no
disarmament, oblivion of the past, and no conscription.
If this is really so then we should lay down—but not give
up—our arms on an honourable peace. But would the
terms be observed afterwards by the Government?
Georges, I know, doubts it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is time to prepare for my Mass. I shall say all three
in a disused church, with the leaders who are here and our
Breton guard for congregation. The proper season for
thoughts of peace.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>December 29.</span>—All those dreams of peace are scattered.
Yesterday, like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, without
warning, without justification, appeared a most violent
and provocative proclamation from the three Consuls to the
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>
inhabitants of the West, denouncing our chiefs—who at
the very moment are in treaty with their representative—but
professing a tenderness for those who had been “led
astray” by them. The Government will pardon those
who repent, but will strike down those who, after this
warning, dare still to resist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone is burning with indignation. Most certainly
the First Consul is not going to play Monk! One begins
to see him, a menacing figure, behind the conciliatory form
of General Hédouville, who wishes us well and has always
acted as an honourable opponent—and who has written,
evidently with regret, that if we cannot come to an agreement
with him by the 15th (he means of their new-fangled
Nivôse, of which to-day is the 8th) hostilities must
begin again, as a result of orders he has received from
Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, as if Fate had determined that they should, M. de
Châtillon has this very day received a letter from Monseigneur
le Comte d’Artois confirming the instructions he
had already sent, not to make peace unless it were part of
a plan for the general pacification of Europe, and saying
that help is on the way, and that he himself will soon be
here. Will he?</p>

<p class='pindent'>If he do come our forces will be doubled in the twinkling
of an eye. Probably the First Consul knows that, and
wishes to have done with us before he could arrive. Bonaparte
must know, too, of our division of opinion, our want
of arms and ammunition and artillery. I feel that he
intends to have victory at any price, and that he would
prefer to crush us rather than to placate—it would give
him more advertisement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So ends the conference of Pouancé. Georges has already
left for the Morbihan; La Prévalaye and Bourmont
have returned, or are returning, to their divisions. We
hear that the victorious army of Holland, under the
detestable Brune, is on the way to Brittany. M. du
Ménars and I start back on our journey to Finistère in an
hour’s time.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Quimperlé, January 4.</span>—We have taken longer than I
expected to reach the soil of Finistère, but we have gone
slowly on purpose, not wishing to get out of touch with
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>
possible developments, for we believe that the indefatigable
Hédouville is trying to get together a new conference in
spite of the shock which slew the first. Yet, if he does,
M. du Ménars and I should not return without an authorisation
which we know well enough Gaston will never
give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now that we have seen with our own eyes to-day a
copy of the far more violent manifesto, signed by the
First Consul, to the Army of the West, we think that the
sooner we are back at the Clos-aux-Grives the better,
for that does not sound like conferences. “The majority
of good citizens,” runs this proclamation, “have already
laid down their arms; there remain only brigands, émigrés,
men in the pay of England—Frenchmen in the pay of
England! March against them; you will not be called
upon to display much valour .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let me soon learn that
the chiefs of the rebels have ceased to exist!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such are a few phrases culled from it. That “Frenchmen
in the pay of England” is a clever and a galling touch.
Indeed, it is the great misfortune of our party to be mixed
up so inextricably with the foreigner. And yet it is not
our fault; it is the fault of circumstances. England
alone, with Austria, continues the struggle; she is rich;
it is she who disposes of the persons of most of our princes,
since they live under her protection.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yet it pleases
me to think that epithet does not apply to Gaston, at any
rate. The promised English subsidy amounted to very
little; it is his own gold, from his own house, which has
made it possible for him to do the wonders he has done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not like that “Let me learn that the chiefs of the
rebels have ceased to exist”; it savours, somehow, of
methods unworthy of a soldier.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 6.</span>—Back at Le Clos-aux-Grives. Gaston (as
I thought I should find him) determined to continue the
struggle, whatever the rest decide. He has the advantage
of the remotest and wildest country, and Georges, his nearest
neighbour, will certainly do as he is doing. But the
forces of Finistère are pitifully small compared to the
enemy’s. If only he could get help by sea from England!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 7.</span>—We hear that there is to be a new conference
opened on the 10th at Candé. Gaston refuses
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>
to have anything to do with it, and indeed it would be
impossible to get there in time now.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 10.</span>—Decidedly we are returning to the worst
days of the Directory. A decree has just come down
declaring the departments of the West outlawed.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 15.</span>—Negotiations were reopened two days ago
at Candé.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 18.</span>—Nothing settled yet at Candé, we hear,
but the rupture of the truce is postponed till January 22.
Gaston speaks of sending me to England.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 20.</span>—Most disastrous news. Two days ago,
at Montfaucon-sur-Moine, the officers of Vendée signed a
separate peace. Alas for the glorious shades of La Roche-jaquelein
and Lescure!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 22.</span>—The truce expires to-day. Anjou is disbanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 24.</span>—Brune’s army is getting nearer every day,
and it is said that he is to replace Hédouville as general-in-chief.
We hear that Bourmont was defeated two days
ago by Chabot at Meslay; unless he can recover, that
means that Maine, too, is gone. Brisk fighting is going
on indeed in the Côtes-du-Nord, but our hopes rest on
Cadoudal, the unbeaten and unyielding. Gaston has sent
M. du Ménars with what men he can spare southwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 25.</span>—A report that yesterday or the day before
Cadoudal fought an indecisive action with Harty, commanding
the troops at Vannes, at Pont-du-Loc. Georges
is not beaten, that is clear, but, if he is not victorious, it
may menace his bold plan of pushing on, after crushing
Harty, to the banks of the Vilaine, and joining hands
with Sol de Grisolles, there to await Brune’s onset—and
after that, perhaps, of joining hands with Gaston.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 26.</span>—Only too true. Georges has sent a courier
to warn Gaston. His plan is hopeless. He fears, too, that
Sol de Grisolles is not in a state to defend the passage of the
Vilaine. And Bourmont has given in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doubtless there <span class='it'>is</span> something in race, and ancient blood.
The prospect before us, once so bright, is hourly more
gloomy, and I know, none better, what failure means
to Gaston. Yet he keeps his profound discouragement
wonderfully to himself, and his little army is still as well
disciplined as it is possible for a Chouan force to be. It is
<span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>
already unsafe for us to make the Clos-aux-Grives our
permanent headquarters. We live dispersed in the
forest, only meeting there occasionally by day, never by
night. I write this, in fact, seated on a fallen stone of
the dolmen where that memorable meeting—about which
I have never been told—took place last August. I wonder
what has become of that misguided madman, the Comte de
Brencourt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston had a letter from the Duchesse to-day, sent by a
stable-boy from La Vergne. I say to myself still, that
whatever happens he can never be captured, in such
proximity to the sea as he will be if we are forced to retire
when Brune enters the Morbihan. He and she can always
take ship for England at the eleventh hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 27.</span>—The garrison of Quimper has evidently
been reinforced. A hot brush to-day on the Lanvennec
road. We have lost forty-three killed and wounded,
among them, alas, two of our few remaining officers.
Roland has got a scratch of which he is rather proud. I
have just been dressing it. Gaston, I could see, was on
tenterhooks about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 28.</span>—Very bad news indeed. Cadoudal has had
to disband his men, for fear of being crushed by Brune’s
advance. These disastrous tidings, getting through by
unknown channels as things do here, have caused some
desertions. Rumours that M. du Ménars is killed. It is
very cold in the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 29.</span>—Brune entered Vannes yesterday, and
made a great requisition of money, overcoats and shoes
for his troops. I <span class='it'>am</span> to go to England. Would I were
not!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 30.</span>—Last night a party of Blues from Lanvennec
sacked and burnt the Clos-aux-Grives. There was no one
there, and it was not worth throwing away lives in its
defence, as it was of little use to us. ‘Les jeunes’ of course
wanted to defend their nursery. The night was red with
the flames of it. Farewell, old house!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is true about M. du Ménars. He was a brave man and
a good officer. R.I.P. His men no longer exist as a
force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want Gaston to make for La Vergne. But he will not,
principally, I think, because all his desire is there. But
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>
it would be an excellent headquarters—or more accurately,
I fear, place of retreat—for a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>February 4.</span>—Cadoudal is reported to be actually treating
with Brune, and the terms, alas, include disarmament. In
a day or two Gaston will find himself literally alone,
with his mere handful of men, against Brune’s whole
army. He still hopes for help from England, and for
some outcome of those ambitious plans which—too late—the
Prince’s council have made, and says that so long
as he can keep open a part of the coast of Finistère for that
purpose, so long he is doing his duty and not sacrificing
men uselessly; and that it will take Brune considerable
time to advance across the Morbihan into Finistère. This
is true. I start for England with his despatches to-morrow
morning. My admiration for him knows no bounds; he
<span class='it'>has</span> broken those “<span class='it'>aspera fata</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this evening I had a letter from Paris, from “Paul
Berry,” which has made me very uneasy. He says—and
he should know, if anyone—that the First Consul is furious
against the “Marquis de Kersaint,”—“that insolent without
an army who still holds out”—and they say that he
has sworn to make an example of one Chouan leader at
least. A horrible fear possesses me that that example
may be made of the last in arms, the highest in rank, and
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. his foe of Rivoli. Does Bonaparte remember that,
I wonder?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much troubled by this letter, which I received after
seeing Gaston and getting my last instructions I went to
him again. The Allée des Vieilles has such a bad reputation
after dark in the district that we have been able to use
it undisturbed as a bivouac. (It makes a detestable one,
owing to the wind on the lande.) I found Gaston walking
up and down in the darkness by the ghostly stones, muffled
in his cloak. I told him what I had just heard from Paris.
He laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the young man from Corsica a bugbear who has
frightened even you, Pierre?” he asked. “I promise
you he shall not have me to ‘make an example of,’ if that
is his phrase, till the last possible moment. And when I
have done all I can—what does it matter if he succeeds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing him in that mood, and feeling that I was leaving
him—with what a heavy heart!—to I know not what
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
imminent perils, I said, “You need never fall into his
hands, Gaston, whatever of defeat happens. Here the
door is always open behind you. The sea——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He interrupted me, in that suddenly freezing voice he
has when he is displeased. “I am surprised at you,
Pierre,” he said, and turned his back on me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was a little hurt; of course I knew better than to insult
him by suggesting that he should desert his men. I only
meant to remind him that should it come to submission—and
in my heart, I can see nothing else before him—once
the formalities over, he can so easily take ship for England.
I explained this, and, though I did not like using this
weapon, I am so afraid of what I may be leaving him to—and
most of all his own indomitable pride—that I added,
“Gaston, remember that you would not sail alone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little quiver went through him, almost as if I had
struck him. He said never a word, but I saw his face for a
second in the light of the camp fire. I presumed, I daresay,
for there is perfect understanding between them on all
things—yet, for all that, surely she should have some consideration
shown her! In that thought lies my best hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I wish to God I were not going to England.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span></p>

<h2 id='b4c5'>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>ALONE IN ARMS</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>About midnight on the 14th of February—her name-day,
which the ladies of La Vergne had celebrated, though with
heavy hearts, by a little feast—Mme de Trélan was awakened
by a commotion in the hall below. Many people
seemed to be there, and she heard the jingle of accoutrements.
For a moment she thought the invaders might be
Republicans; then, with a leap of the heart, that it might
conceivably be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. someone else. She opened her door
and listened, and, since sounds floated very clearly up
the great staircase, she did catch the sound she craved for.
She flung on a cloak and went out into the gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down in the hall, in the midst of his remaining staff, her
husband was apologising with great courtesy for taking
possession of Mme de la Vergne’s house without leave.
Nothing, he declared, but necessity would have made him
do so. As she must be aware, he had his back fairly to the
wall now; there were only sixty men with him, but it
was possible that by using La Vergne as a centre he might
succeed in rallying the broken remnants of the late M. du
Ménars’ force. On the morrow he would lay before the
three ladies the arrangements he proposed for their conveyance
to a place of safety—though he had no intention,
he assured her, of allowing himself to be attacked in the
château.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Valentine heard Mme de la Vergne, a perfectly
dignified figure, despite her hastily donned <span class='it'>déshabillé</span>, in
the little crowd of uniformed and booted and lantern-bearing
men, reply quite calmly that there was no need
to waste time over such a discussion. “My daughter and
I shall have the honour to entertain you in our house,
Monsieur le .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Marquis, for as long as you require it.
All we have is at your disposal. But we do not intend to
leave it.”
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine did not wait for Gaston’s reply; she knew
he would not argue the point then in front of his officers,
including, as they did, his hostess’s son. Returning to her
room, she began to rekindle the dying fire there, to warm
him when he came. She felt a little stunned. She had
not known that things were going as ill as this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later she heard his knock at her door.
As he entered she saw how his air was changed—for it was
not only that his uniform was worn and stained, his boots
covered with mud, the scarf she had embroidered soiled—and
the change went like a knife through her heart. But
all he did, the first greetings over, was to apologise for his
state—the gentleman of the great world ashamed for
appearing so in the presence of a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not fit to be in your room, Valentine,” he said,
looking down at himself with distaste. “I have not had
my clothes off for the last week. You must forgive this
unceremonious visit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was sitting in her chair again now, and he stood
by her in the firelight. Pride and anguish strove together
in her as she looked up at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston, I heard what you said in the hall. Tell me
the worst, my darling! We have heard that Cadoudal
is treating with the Republicans, but we cannot believe it.
But if it should be true, if he should submit, would there
be no one left in arms at all—no one in the Côtes-du-Nord
even——no one but you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could only see his profile. He was fingering a little
Chinese figure that stood on her mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where does this mandarin come from, I wonder?
It reminds me of one we had at Mirabel. We had several,
I think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Then he looked down at her. “Yes,
Valentine, it is the last act. Cadoudal <span class='it'>has</span> submitted.
He signed near Vannes yesterday .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I <span class='it'>am</span> alone in arms;
there is no one else left. Unless help comes from England
in the next few days——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off, turned back to the mandarin, and then,
abruptly, his sword clanking against the floor as he did so,
knelt down and buried his face on her knees. And, fighting
back the sob that rose in her own throat, she folded her
arms round his neck and kissed the wet, iron-grey hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My darling, my darling, how tired you are!” She
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
smoothed the bowed head as she would have smoothed a
child’s, terribly conscious all the time of the restraint he
was putting on himself not to break down altogether. For
his hands were gripping the arms of her chair on either side
of her, and every now and again a shudder went through
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will never consent to the disarmament of Finistère,
never—never—never!” he said in a smothered voice. “I
will die first!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hand stopped. “Is that what you fear, Gaston?
Is that it? O my knight without reproach, you shall do
what you think best. If it is necessary—if you must in
honour—you shall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not hold you back.” But she had no need to
add that, and she did not. Her husband lifted his head,
almost frightened at the sublimity of her self-forgetfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Valentine,” he exclaimed, “is it possible that you—a
woman—<span class='it'>understand</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love you,” she said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knelt there staring at her, the firelight showing, on
his sad and weary features, an expression that was almost
awe. Then he made a movement and caught her to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said you were my oriflamme. I shall fight to the
last as long as I have the means, and with how much more
courage if you give me leave to die! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I shall not
let them attack La Vergne, though you, I know, would not
fear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor would the others,” she answered. “Then will you
not make it your headquarters?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know yet. When Brune’s advance begins
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But though I do not intend to stand a siege here, I fear
I must send you and the other ladies away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine said nothing, but a little shiver went through
her in her turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true,” said Gaston, feeling it, “that Mme de la
Vergne has already refused to go. And you, my darling——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must do as you think best,” she said again. She
would not give open utterance to the wild prayer that was
ringing through her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sighed, and loosing his hold of her hands, got to his
feet, drawing her up with him.
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston, you will sleep now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “I must go round the sentries again
first. All my officers—all that are left, that is—are as
weary as I. As for a bed, I have not seen one for weeks.
Something harder will be more familiar. I shall sleep in
the hall; there is a bearskin rug there that promises well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you sleep last night, Gaston?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice changed. “In a very holy place, beloved—the
place where you came back to me from the dead—the
Allée des Vieilles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed her on the brow and went out.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“I never thought,” said Artamène next day to Roland,
with one of his old flashes of gaiety, not so frequent now
as of yore. “I never thought that I should live to admire
my own mother more than Cleopatra or la Grande Mademoiselle
and other determined ladies! Imagine her
standing up to M. le Duc like that—and routing him! It
is for you to tremble, Roland, at these unsuspected qualities,
since as your future mother-in-law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For before the unshakable determination of Mme de la
Vergne not to be turned out of her own house, as evinced
in a private interview with the friendly invader that
morning, the determination—perhaps not quite so strong—of
the Duc de Trélan to turn her out was baffled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Lucien, “that there are disadvantages
in being a gentleman. M. le Marquis is always grand
seigneur; had he been one of these sans-culotte generals
he would have bundled her out without ceremony—excuse
the verb, mon cher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are compensations, too,” observed Roland.
“Thanks to the admirable—or ominous—firmness of
Mme de la Vergne, the Duchesse can remain also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You pointedly omit the advantage to yourself, I
notice,” said Marthe’s brother, “It will be my duty to
call you out for that, Roland, to-morrow morning. There
being no .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no Moulin-aux-Fées handy, I suggest
rakes, in the poultry-yard; but you shall be buried in the
arbour of famous memory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder how long any of us will stay here,” observed
Lucien thoughtfully. “And as to being buried—we may
not have much choice in the matter of locality.”
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The other two looked at him with equal thoughtfulness,
for in this ebb of fortune the idea was not by now a new one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I make only one stipulation about my death,” announced
the Chevalier de la Vergne with composure, “and
that is, to fall at the same moment as M. le Duc. And you,
Roland, have you chosen yours? You look as if you were
selecting it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I was thinking about Mme la Duchesse,” answered
the young man rather unexpectedly.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It is a terrible hour when a man of superlative pride and
self-will learns that Destiny—or another man—has a
stronger will than he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this hour struck for Gaston de Trélan the very day
after his arrival at La Vergne, when he received an ultimatum
from General Brune giving him twenty-four hours
in which to consent to an unconditional surrender, involving
disarmament as well as disbandment. Otherwise the army
of Holland, already on the march, would enter Finistère
at several points—Finistère laid open to them not only
by the capitulation of her more formidable neighbours,
the Morbihan and the Côtes-du-Nord, but also by the
dispersal of her own defenders. Never very numerous,
they had quite forsaken the standard now, returning to
their farms or going into hiding, and during the last few
days it had become abundantly clear that all “M. de Kersaint’s”
careful organisation was in ruins; despairing
reports from subordinates, gentlemen or Chouans, in the
outlying districts, each said that their little bands had
melted away like snow. His own personal followers were,
indeed, more than ever devoted, but the flame he had lit
through Finistère was out, and he stood, a beaten man,
among its ashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet though he might be overwhelmed by numbers and
his men scattered, so long as the arms he had been at such
pains to procure for them were not given up to the enemy
but hidden (as was the case) he had not utterly failed,
since Finistère would not be defenceless for the future.
And to disarmament he had said that he would never
consent—he would rather die. Now it was required of
him to give the order for it immediately. More, within
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
less than ten days he was to surrender his own sword in
person to the Republican commander-in-chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this culminating humiliation Brune—or rather, that
intense and vehement personality in Paris of whom Brune
was but the mouthpiece—insisted absolutely. The Marquis
de Kersaint, he wrote (following his instructions)
must not only submit at once, and effectually disarm his
men, but he must also be at Vannes on February 24 to give
up his sword and ratify the whole transaction. If not,
the preceding evidences of submission would go for nothing,
and Finistère would be laid waste without the loss of a day:
every man known to have fought under him would be shot,
every fifth house burnt in the insurgent villages. Nothing
would avail him unless he regularised the situation by giving
up his own sword; and to that end Brune sent him, with
the ultimatum, safe-conducts for himself and an escort of
three or four persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no choice, no shadow of a possible alternative.
It was not merely that Gaston de Trélan’s military situation
was hopeless—almost ludicrously so—alone with a few
score men not merely against Brune, but, since the submission
of the other leaders, against La Barolière and
Chabot as well; it was that if he refused the terms he was
condemning Finistère to the fate that had been Vendée’s
years ago under Turreau’s <span class='it'>colonnes infernales</span>. If he had
any heart in him, any humanity, he must drink this bitter
cup. The chance of dying had not been granted him; to
kill himself was tantamount to refusing. No help, no word
of help, had come from England; he did not even know
whether the Abbé had reached his destination. Besides,
no help could possibly come in time now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing, nothing was left save the desperate honour of
having been the last to uphold the splendid hopes with
which, in the autumn, this business had begun—that, and
a woman’s love and admiration and succour. It was Valentine
who saw the dark waters close above his head and
went down with him to the depths; and, when the moment
came that the words were wrenched from him, as from a
man on the rack—“<span class='it'>There is no way out of it—no possible
way out; I must do it!</span>” it was she who wrote at his dictation
the letter to Brune saying that, for the sake of the
lives of others, he agreed to the terms of surrender, would
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
give the necessary orders, and afterwards, availing himself
of the safe-conduct, would reach Vannes by the day
appointed to give up his sword in person to the General-in-chief.</p>

<h3>(3)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The same night that this letter arrived at its destination,
a young Republican officer was lying in his bed at the
Hôtel de l’Epée at Vannes, not unmindful of his good fortune
in having it to himself. The town was crammed with
Republican troops, and was likely to be even fuller in a few
days, when the drafts <span class='it'>en route</span> for Finistère were recalled,
as they presumably would be now that the Marquis de Kersaint
had agreed to submit, which recent piece of news was
known to the young officer—his name was Marcel Poulain—because
he was on Brune’s staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was nearly asleep when the door was suddenly opened,
and the landlord’s apologetic voice informed him that an
aide-de-camp of the First Consul’s had just come in dead-beat,
and, having delivered his urgent despatches to the
General, must be given a bed at once. Unfortunately there
was not a bed in the place which had not two occupants
already except——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes there is,” interrupted the young man angrily,
“Next door. Put him there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot, sir,” retorted the landlord. “The gentleman
next door is indisposed, and is also, I think, a Royalist.
And the aide-de-camp has scarcely drawn rein since leaving
Paris.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very well,” groaned Marcel resignedly, and almost
immediately the heavy, stumbling steps of the exhausted
courier could be heard along the corridor, and in another
moment he staggered in and fell with a jangle of spurs and
a groan on to a chair. Marcel, on his elbow, scrutinised
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” he exclaimed, “I’m damned if it’s not Adolphe
Bergeron!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I scarcely know who I am,” returned the other hoarsely.
“I only know that I am absolutely in pieces. I killed one
horse .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and all for——” He did not say for what.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And presently, his friend having made room for him, he
stretched himself out beside him with more groans, and
complaints of the hardness of the bed.
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor devil!” said Marcel sympathetically. “And so
you knew what was in your despatches. I hope it was
worth flaying yourself for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not know when I left Paris,” answered the rider,
moving restlessly. “Nor when I got here. But Brune
has just let it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, was it worth it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no reply. “Adolphe, you need not be so
deuced discreet! I’m on the staff, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the staff at least will know it to-morrow,” muttered
Adolphe. “—Don’t let anyone guess that you
have been told already, that’s all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know that
man who organised Finistère, de Kersaint?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think I did!” responded Marcel with animation.
“The General has been getting furious despatches
about him almost every day of late from the First Consul,
saying that he must be finished with at once, by whatever
means. His being the only one of the Royalist leaders
who would have nothing to do with the idea of pacification—even
Cadoudal came down to it in the end—has, I suppose,
enraged Bonaparte. However, Brune has got him in a
cleft stick at last, and he has agreed to all the terms,
including the surrender of his sword. I saw the letter
myself this afternoon—in a woman’s hand it was. Have
your despatches to do with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have,” said Adolphe. “Exclusively. He is
coming under a safe-conduct, I take it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. The General sent it some days ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is to be withdrawn. That’s what
I have flayed myself for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>What!</span> O, but that’s a mistake; it can’t be withdrawn
now. De Kersaint has accepted it; he is going to
use it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be frank,” said Adolphe, gazing at the still-burning
candle, “I only said ‘withdrawn’ to make it sound better.
It really comes to this, that it will not be observed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other bounded up in bed. “But, great God,
man——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, I know! But I can’t help it—it is the First
Consul’s orders.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The fact is, Bonaparte means to
have this Marquis de Kersaint alive or dead—you have said
as much yourself—and now, I suppose, he will get him.”
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God!” said his friend, and lay down again in
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I had known what I was carrying,” said Adolphe after
a little, “I might have had—an accident. But I had no
idea, and it is done now. The order will be sent on to
Auray and other places to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Order!</span> But it’s impossible—one can’t send an order
like that! Surely a safe-conduct, once given, is the most
sacred thing a soldier knows. If he does not observe it—O,
it’s the dirtiest, most damnable treachery I ever heard
of! Pah! is that the way they do things in Corsica?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chut, mon ami, walls have ears,” said the aide-de-camp
wearily. “But you are right; it is infamous. They
say in Paris that <span class='it'>he</span> has all along wanted someone of whom
to make an example, for the sake of the impression. Yet
all the other leaders submitted, as you say. But this
man who has held out so, besides that he put Bonaparte to
inconvenience at Rivoli—ah, I forgot, you were there—is
also, it appears, a ci-devant of the ci-devants; no less
than the Duc de Trélan, in fact. Brune let that out too;
Fouché, it seems, discovered it. So he would be worth
capturing, and Brune, not being troubled with scruples,
will obey orders.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And <span class='it'>I</span> brought them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish now you had not told me,” said Brune’s young
staff-officer.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Another than he had been told also, for walls <span class='it'>have</span> ears,
and that by the side of their bed happened to be merely a
cracked wooden partition. The officer of Bourmont’s
disbanded army who lay ill in the next room had, therefore,
heard every word of their conversation. He was Artus de
Brencourt.
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span></p>

<h2 id='b4c6'>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>“SWORD, THY NOBLER USE IS DONE!”</h3>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Le vin est versé; il faut le boire.</span>” The words of the old
adage rang in Valentine’s head to-night. Not long ago
Gaston had quoted them. She had never before so felt
their inexorable quality—for to-morrow he must set out
to Vannes to drink it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He had said farewell to his
very few remaining officers, disbanded, of his handful of
men, all but a few sentries, and wanted to ride alone to his
surrender, but ‘les jeunes’ had made such an outcry at this,
and begged so hard to be his escort, that, as the other
safe-conducts were blank, he consented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was past midnight, and he was still writing, by the
light of a couple of candles, at a table in the embrasure of
the large window in their room at La Vergne. Despite the
cold, Valentine was sitting on the seat in the space between
her husband and the heavily curtained window—the seat
where, that October night, she had found and kissed his
sword. Now, that same sword.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She looked between
the candle-flames at his downbent face. One hand supported
his head as he wrote, the fingers running up into the
thick, rippling hair. The last three months of strain had
aged him a little; but she saw nothing there that she
did not love and honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The château was very still. Now and again, even
through the closed window, Valentine could hear the footfall
of the sentry on the flags below. But, after the recent
armed occupation, this was like the last moments before
death. To-morrow there would be no sentry—nothing to
guard. It would all be over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pulled aside the curtain and looked out. There was
a royal moon; she had forgotten it. The terrace sparkled
with thinly fallen snow, and she could see how it powdered
the bare, pleached boughs of the arbour where, in the
spring, Roland and the son and daughter of the house
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span>
had planned the invasion of Mirabel. And she saw, too,
in the distance—or was it fancy?—a silver streak, the
sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, if they were there, embarking—if Gaston could but
be spared the purgatory that lay before him first. She
glanced at him again. He had death in his soul; she
knew that. <span class='it'>Le vin est versé</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not merely that he shrank, as any soldier might,
from the personal humiliation of surrendering his sword;
it was also that he had given to this enterprise, so nearly
successful, not only his arm, but his heart. Only lately
had she come to see what the overthrow of the cause meant
to him; indeed she had not fully learnt it yet. Was he
writing to the Comte d’Artois, she wondered now—to the
Prince who, once again, had never come? If <span class='it'>she</span> had
held the pen there were words, burning words, that she
would have written to that royal laggard! O, how could
the man exist who knew that a whole population was
sacrificing itself for him and his family, that for years
they had been dying for him on the battlefield and the
scaffold, that his appearance was the one thing they asked
of life, and his presence would cause all that suffering and
sacrifice to be forgotten—how could he know all this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and not come!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine clenched her hands. He whom she loved was
driven to this pass through Charles of Bourbon. He had
fought to keep open a harbour for the sails that never
came, and was now left, deserted and alone, to drink this
bitter wine.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The tears began to creep down her face—tears
of wrath. She did not want Gaston to see them, and
turning away, her forehead against the cold glass, she
swallowed them down, trying to fix her thoughts instead
on that silver gleam of sea, which, when the surrender
was consummated, would bear them both away from the
land of the once more lost cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she had regained her self-control she dropped the
curtain and turned back into the room. Her husband
had laid down his pen and was leaning back in his chair,
his hands along the arms. His look was remote and very
grave. She rose from the seat, knelt down beside him and
took his right hand in both of hers. His gaze came from
far off and rested on her—still very grave.
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston, I believe I can see the sea—the moon is so
bright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” said he, with a note of enquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we were down there now,” she went on rather
unsteadily, “—where the yellow poppies bloomed last
autumn. Do you remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I remember? Do I ever forget? I have them
safe—what you gave me.” He touched his breast with his
other hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My darling, if they could only bring you forgetfulness—forgetfulness
of to-morrow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “They will not easily do that.”
From her his glance strayed to the sheathed sword lying
on the table. She could not bear to see his face when he
looked at it, and hid her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed then to make an effort to turn his thoughts.
“You were speaking of the sea, beloved. When this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
this business is over, the sea shall take us away at last to
happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine raised her head quickly. “At last! Gaston,
no happiness over the sea, in tranquillity, can ever have
the taste of this I have known, in warfare, since last summer!
It can never be better, even as this, come what may,
can never be less. If it ended to-morrow, you know that
I have lived to see all that I dreamt of—more than I
dreamt of! O, my knight, when the utmost has been
wrought, what matters the broken sword! Please God
there are many more happy days before us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but not
better, not happier days!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their lips met in silence. Then, as she knelt there, he
bowed his head till it rested on her shoulder. Grief and
love were one.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The promise of the serene moon of the night was not
fulfilled. Flurries of sleet were sweeping over the countryside
next morning; the strip of sea was the colour of slate,
and the wind howled in all the tall chimneys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this tumult Gaston bade farewell to Valentine upstairs.
He and his escort calculated to reach Quimperlé
that night, and Vannes the next, so that, unless the roads
were in very bad condition, she might hope to see him back
on the fourth day.
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Downstairs in the wide hall with the young men were
Mme de la Vergne and Marthe, the former as if she clung
to the fiction of speeding a parting guest. But they were
all very quiet, looking silently at the staircase when the
Duc de Trélan, pale and upright, came down it pulling on
his gauntlets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have your safe-conducts on you, gentlemen, I
hope?” he said as he descended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have <span class='it'>you</span> your safe-conduct, Monsieur le Duc?”
asked Marthe impulsively, coming to the foot of the stairs.
Her little hands were clenched; she hated this business
almost as much as he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gaston reassured the impetuous girl, and saluted
Mme de la Vergne while Artamène went down the steps
to the horses, already there in charge of Lucien and a
groom. Roland remained, the Duc’s riding cloak over his
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate this day more than any God ever made!” said
his betrothed to him under her breath. Her eyes looked
as if she had not slept. Roland took her hands and drew
her to him, but he could not give her any verbal comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, just as M. de Trélan was bending in farewell
over Mme de la Vergne’s fingers, there came with the cold
wind through the open door the sound of a galloping horse
stayed at the very perron, expostulatory voices at the
bottom, and feet running up the steps. Next moment,
breathing hard, a man burst into the hall with Artamène
behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God, I am in time!” he jerked out—pulled
off his hat as he saw the ladies, and revealed the features of
the Comte de Brencourt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was spattered with mud and half melted snow up to
his very shoulders; his riding boots were one cake of it.
But he went straight towards the Duc de Trélan, disregarding
every one else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t go to Vannes, de Kersaint!” (the old name
was evidently still the more natural). “Don’t go, for
God’s sake—there is treachery!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marthe gave a cry that went unheeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Treachery!” ejaculated Gaston. His eyes lit up.
“You dare to come and use that word in front of me—<span class='it'>you!</span>—But,
perhaps, as an expert, you feel privileged?”
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte at that terrible rebuff stood a moment
rigid, then he reeled a step backwards exactly as if
he had been struck. Encountering a high-backed chair
he gripped it with one hand, steadied himself, and said,
in a voice that the air seemed to dissipate, “Your safe-conduct
is waste paper.” His face was quite grey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duc surveyed him pitilessly for a second or two;
then he slightly shrugged his shoulders and turned away.
“I am afraid that you have ridden very hard to no
purpose, Monsieur,” he observed. “Roland, my cloak,
please!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte flung out his free hand. “You are going to
your death!” he said wildly. “You are mad—I have
warned you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Where is Mme de Trélan, she might——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave my wife’s name out of your fabrications,
if you please!” said Gaston like a rapier thrust, turning
on his heel towards him for a brief instant. “Well,
Roland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thunderstruck young man approached with the
cloak, and put it on his leader’s shoulders in the midst of an
extraordinary silence which even Artamène did not dare
to break. It was the messenger of destiny himself who
broke it, with something between a sob and a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are all mad here, I think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Madame—or you,
Mademoiselle, perhaps you have some influence? As there
is a God above us, it is a matter of this gentleman’s life.
Orders have come from the First Consul to Brune that his
safe-conduct is not to be observed, and those orders have
been transmitted at least as far as Auray, and probably
further by this time. Can you not stop him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at that Gaston flung his cloak back on to Roland’s
arm, went up to Mme de la Vergne, said something to her
in a low tone which caused her and Marthe to withdraw
to the other end of the hall, motioned Roland and Artamène
also away, and, going up to the Comte, looked him in
the eyes and said in a voice vibrating with anger, “No man
or woman living keeps me from doing what I intend to do—have
you not learnt that yet, Monsieur de Brencourt?
And, as for your story, I certainly put more faith in
Brune’s honour than in yours!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte, livid, swallowed something in his throat.
“Your safe-conduct is waste paper,” he repeated. “I
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>
heard it with my own ears.” Then he broke out with
some of his old vehemence, “Good God, de Trélan, why
won’t you believe me?—If this were not true, why do you
think I have ridden nearly eighty miles, ill as I am, in this
mad haste?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man he had so treacherously used continued to look
at him. He had not raised his own voice at all, and it was
low now, unhurried, and colder than the wind from glaciers.
“That is a question which only you can answer, Monsieur
le Comte. I cannot pretend to fathom the motives of a
man so utterly false as you. I can only suppose that
having failed in the past to deprive me of my life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
more than my life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you are now trying to take from me
something more precious than either, my honour. But
I am not to be frightened by talk of treachery into
breaking my pledged word. You have failed this time
also, Monsieur de Brencourt.—Come, gentlemen, it is time
to start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had finally turned his back. The Comte, speechless,
bowed his head against the high chair to which he was
holding. What could he do against this attitude? He had
anticipated contempt, hatred, but never disbelief. He
lifted his head once more, tried to say, “For your wife’s
sake!” but the words stuck in his throat, and besides, the
Duc was at the door now with the young men—was descending
the steps. All that came to his dry lips was the old
tag, “Your blood be on your own head!” Then his
limbs gave way beneath him, and he collapsed into
the chair, hiding his face in his hands. Outside there
were sounds of mounting and of riding away; then
silence.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Marthe and her mother, with rather pale faces, looked at
each other, and then at the mudstained figure huddled in the
chair, the elder woman uneasily, Marthe with distaste.
Since the Duc so disbelieved his story, they disbelieved it
too. Then Mme de la Vergne, mindful as ever of the
claims of hospitality, addressed the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I not order some refreshment for you after your
ride, Monsieur?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At her voice de Brencourt roused himself, and rose stiffly.
But he responded by a question.
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is your house, Madame, I think—not the Duc de
Trélan’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly it is my house,” responded Mme de la Vergne.
The gentleman looked ghastly ill, as she now saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I should be very glad of a glass of wine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
before I ride away again. My mission .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has been
fruitless, but I am .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” His voice tailed off
into nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur, sit down again—you are unwell!” cried
Mme de la Vergne sharply. Whatever the subject of
disagreement between him and M. de Trélan—and it must
have been very acute—she did not want to have him
fainting in her hall. “Marthe, go and order something
to be brought at once—and pray give yourself the trouble
to come to the fire, Monsieur; you must be frozen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt obeyed, but with difficulty, and sank
into a great chair that she pushed forward. “You do
not object to my being in your house a little? The
treachery—you heard that?—is not what you probably
think. O, my God, my God, why did I come myself?
He might have listened to someone else!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he found himself alone. He put his cold hand over
his eyes and groaned aloud. Yes, the desperate fight he
had had with himself to do this thing in person, after his
failure to find a trustworthy messenger—and the result,
the reward! Surely, in the few minutes that had
passed, he had paid to the full. But he had paid in
vain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His head was swimming; his body frozen. A tray
appeared beside him, brought by that scornful girl herself.
She vanished again. He seized and drained the glass of
wine upon it, and a little warmth stole into him. He heard
a footstep, the flow of a robe; the lady of the house back
again, no doubt. But, when he looked round, there, gazing
at him in astonishment, was the Duchesse de Trélan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up and flung himself towards her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did it for your sake,” he cried, hardly knowing what
he said, “—and he repulsed me like a dog. I was told I
should live to do you a service .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I thought the
day had come. But he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he affected to think it was
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. false .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he has gone, despite my warning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Warning!” stammered Valentine, blanching. “Warning
<span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span>
of what? I was above—I did not know that you were
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I imagine so,” he retorted bitterly. But she had no
room in her mind for any emotion but one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You came to warn M. de Trélan?” she said, and he
saw that she was twisting her fingers together. “That was
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I thank you. But—what is the danger? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='it'>because he is gone!</span>” The last four words came out with
little less than terror behind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could do her the immense, deliberate, though defeated
wrong that he had done, but, face to face with her again,
after all he had sinned and suffered, he shrank from dealing
her the blow his undiluted knowledge must deal. And it
was too late now for any benefit to come of it, for, as she
had said, the Duc was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped his eyes. “I heard a rumour,” he said,
“that there was a regiment of the soldiers from Holland
somewhere on the Vannes road, and that they might not
be too particular in the observance of a safe-conduct.
That was all; and no doubt it was false .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and at
any rate,” he added, his bitterness getting the better of
him again, “M. de Trélan saw fit not only to disregard my
warning, but to insult me into the bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to observe the safe-conduct!” exclaimed the
Duchesse sharply. “But that is unthinkable!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(Yes, anything but <span class='it'>his</span> peril had passed her by; that
was clear.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right, it is really unthinkable,” he answered
wearily. “I was a fool to come, and I will relieve you of
my presence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He meant, indeed, on that to walk straight out of the
place. But he was not a young man; he had been ill;
he had asked too much of his body. His head turned
once more, and violently; he caught at the arm of the
chair from which he had risen, and, not to fall altogether,
slid back into it. And then the mud, the pallor, the
deadly fatigue were all visible to Valentine, and she realised
with a shock the thing he had done—for her. He saw it
in her face as she came to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do believe me then, Valentine? It may not be
true, but I believed it!” he said confusedly, forgetting that
he had not revealed the heart of the peril. “And I tried
<span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>
to stop him—against my will, yes, against my will! But
you do believe me,—in spite of the past?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hoarse words were torn out of him, and when she
let him have her hand as she bent over him, he put his
head down on it and broke into a moment’s strangled
sobbing.
<span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span></p>

<h2 id='b4c7'>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>HOW AT THE LAST THE WINE WAS NOT DRUNK</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>By very hard going the four riders got to Quimperlé that
night, despite the state of the roads. They slept there
entirely unmolested; a small detachment of troops indeed
occupied the town, but the mere sight of Brune’s signature
was enough. And the anxiety of ‘les jeunes’ at least—the
Duc would not discuss the matter—‘les jeunes’ who had
only half heard, was much allayed. It did not strike them
that they were still within the confines of Finistère, and
that possibly the disgraceful orders had not yet crossed the
Scorff. Yet, all unknown to their leader, they took that
night in the hôtel a certain precaution which might have
remained unknown to him, had he not, waking in the dark
of the early morning, and perplexed by a sound outside his
door for which he could not account, lit a candle and
softly opened it; and so come on his own son stretched out
there asleep across the threshold, his pistols within reach
of his hand, and his drawn sword beneath his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston looked down, not a little moved, at that embodiment
of his own youth guarding him, and, shading the
light, contemplated the sleeping boy as he had done last
year in the attic at Hennebont. Laure’s face, grown so
shadowy now, came back for a moment to haunt him.
“I wish I could tell him,” he said to himself. But there
was his promise; and with a sigh he went in and closed the
door again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duc made no reference next morning to his discovery,
and thus never learnt that they had all taken their turns
in devotion. When they reached Pont-Scorff they were
already in the Morbihan, but through Pont-Scorff they rode
without even having to show their safe-conducts. As
Auray was rather too long a stage before the mid-day meal,
and as the horses, with the exception of Zéphyr, were now
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>
going none too well, they decided to eat déjeuner at Hennebont,
and about noon they drew rein before the chief inn
in the little town which had seen them creep into it like
thieves in the dusk, nearly a year ago. But though they
came openly now they were incomparably heavier-hearted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they dismounted, Gaston desired two of them to
look after the tired horses while he ordered the meal.
Lucien and Artamène detached themselves for this duty,
and disappeared down a dark entry with the four steeds.
The Duc, followed by Roland, entered the inn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidently Hennebont was full of soldiers; officers of all
arms were lounging outside and inside the door of the
hostelry, but, though they looked with extreme curiosity
at the Royalists, no one seemed to find their presence
unnatural, or made the faintest show of asking for some
authorisation of it. Not even to Gaston did it occur that
here, in the Morbihan, they were being taken for officers of
Cadoudal’s disbanded army who had presumably not yet
divested themselves of their uniforms, but who were none
the less amnestied. To Roland it was an extraordinary
experience to pass through these throngs of Blues as if
they possessed some charm; they did not even need to
show those safe-conducts. But of course they were safe
with an honourable foe; were their enemies not fellow-countrymen?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inn parlour, with its small round tables, was crowded
with guests, both civil and military. As M. de Trélan
came in, followed by the young man, not a few looked up
at the two handsome Chouan officers, of whom Gaston’s
high rank could only be guessed at by the air of distinction
that never left him, for he was not openly wearing his
scarf, and the little cross on his breast was too rare a decoration
to be widely known. They sat down at the only
unoccupied table, one in a corner opposite the door, and
the Duc ordered four covers. The be-coiffed peasant girl
who received his commands asked for indulgence if there
were delay, for, as the gentlemen could see, they were very
busy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I go out then, and help the others with the horses,
Sir?” suggested Roland. His leader nodded, and Roland
got up, still thinking how odd it was to sit down placidly
and eat in a room full of Blues. There were quite a dozen
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>
officers there—hussars, dragoons and infantry. The eyes
of some of these officers followed him as he threaded his
way between the tables. Possibly they also found it
piquant to see a former foe moving about unmolested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feminine eyes followed him, too, appreciative of his
youth and looks, eyes set in the face of a youngish, buxom
woman wearing an extravagant bonnet and luxurious
furs of marten who sat—strangely enough, with her back
to most of the company—at a table in one of the other
corners. With her was a big florid man over whose air of
importance, every time he looked at his companion, there
passed a milder and obscuring gleam, even as a light cloud
drifts over the face of the moon. Any guests who had
noticed them decided that they were probably bride and
bridegroom, and all the more sentimental because they
were neither of them in their first youth. And newly wed
in fact they were—M. and Mme Georges Camain, on their
way to Lorient, at which port M. Camain had to inspect
some warehouses for the Government. By taking his
Rose with him he hoped to combine pleasure with business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme Camain’s eyes, therefore, travelled after the young
man, as he entered her sphere of vision just before going
through the door. Her husband thereupon leant over the
table and tapped her on the pretty, plump hand with the
new wedding ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eyes right, please!” he said jocosely. “You are only
allowed to look at me now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He reminds me of someone, that child,” observed the
lady reflectively. “A long time ago .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eat your partridge, ma mie, and never mind about
the days before the Flood,” commanded Camain, setting
her the example. “Remember, too, that we have ordered
the carriage to be at the door by one o’clock, and that
time is getting on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose pouted. “I suppose you think you have a right
to be jealous now, vieux monstre!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not only a right, but a duty!” returned the
monster cheerfully, going on eating, however, with a very
care-free appetite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Rose was intrigued by the passage of the young man.
“I wonder if he was alone?” she murmured, and, between
taking pecks at her partridge, continually turned her head
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>
and craned her neck towards that quarter of the room from
which she divined that he had come. But it was in vain;
for, short of getting up and turning round altogether, she
could not see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gaston de Trélan, at that table in the corner, his
head on his hand, his thoughts far away, sat waiting for
the advent of the meal and the return of his aides-de-camp.
The two nearest officers, dragoons, with their heads close
together over their wine, alternately looked at him and
whispered to one another. Meanwhile people ate steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All at once Rose, whose curiosity, though almost motiveless,
was proving too strong for her, saying to her astonished
husband, “I think I must have dropped my handkerchief
from my reticule as I came in,” got up from her place
before he had time to protest, and walked, her eyes on the
floor as though searching for something, till she came to a
spot whence she could conveniently glance at that one
table in the corner which she could not see when seated.
Having arrived there, she sped a look at it—at the
Royalist officer sitting there alone who, as she moved
across the room, raised preoccupied eyes in her
direction.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next moment the entire company was electrified to see
the pretty little woman in the marten furs clasp her hands
suddenly together, and give a tiny scream which penetrated
through all the clatter of knives and the babel of conversation.
And then, more or less of silence having descended,
she broke out with a name—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur de Trélan! Is it possible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And not to realise who was the object of this touching
recognition was difficult, for the solitary Chouan officer
in the corner, after staring a moment, rose slowly to his
feet and bowed—as a man bows to an unknown lady.
Yet Rose stood there, her face quite white under her
preposterous bonnet, apparently oblivious that every eye
was either on her, or on the man to whom she had drawn
attention. Then the wave of mild universal surprise was
broken into and flung aside by a billow of a much more
menacing kind. For, with an exclamation, one of the
neighbouring officers of dragoons leapt to his feet, his
chair falling backwards behind him, and strode in front of
the Royalist’s table.
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur de Trélan—or Monsieur de Kersaint, as
you prefer—will you have the kindness to follow me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston, coldly amused, surveyed him for a moment.
“No, Monsieur, I must beg to decline,” he said. “Your
zeal is admirable, but misplaced.” And he laid his hand
on the back of his chair, with a view, evidently, to sitting
down again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You deny then that you are de Kersaint, the general of
Finistère?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for a moment!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said the officer with a gesture, “it is my unpleasant
duty to arrest you. You will be wise, as you see,
not to resist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duc de Trélan relinquished his hold of the chair and
drew himself up. “You must be dreaming, Monsieur,”
he retorted. “You have no power to arrest me. I am
on my way to Vannes under General Brune’s safe-conduct.
You must know that, since you know who I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all reply the officer turned and beckoned to the
rest. But his companion was already there beside him,
and from every quarter of the room the other Republicans
were hurrying, between the tables, to that table in the corner
behind which stood their quarry, alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a safe-conduct,” repeated Gaston very haughtily.
“Am I not speaking to Frenchmen?—I have this also!”
He took a step or two backwards, and his sword sprang
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better come without resistance, Monsieur de
Kersaint,” said the officer of dragoons menacingly. “I
have a squadron of my men out there within hail, and
these gentlemen, you can see, are in receipt of the same
orders. As for your aide-de-camp——” He snapped his
fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Camain, pushing his bulky form through the onlookers,
here broke in. “Look here, gentlemen, this
officer says he has a safe-conduct. Give him at least the
chance of showing it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you?” asked the dragoon rudely over his
shoulder. “A damned civilian! This is a matter for the
military, thanks! The Chouan general de Kersaint is to
be arrested, safe-conduct or no safe-conduct; those are
the orders of the First Consul himself!”
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Camain drew up his imposing figure. “I am deputy for
the department of Maine-et-Loire,” he declared in his
deepest voice. “(Be quiet, Rose!) What you are proposing
to do is atrocious, and I protest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go back to your department then, and protest there!”
retorted the officer insolently. “Now that Madame has
so obligingly furnished the identification we wanted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Once more, Monsieur de Kersaint, will you come, or will
you have a useless mêlée here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston set his teeth. It was true after all, this
incredible infamy! If he had listened to de Brencourt!
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Valentine—should he ever see her again? The room,
seething now with excitement, swam for a second.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No,
they should not take him alive! This, the last, would be
a good fight—one against how many .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. twelve, thirteen?
He slipped a couple of feet further backwards
still, till he was almost in the angle of the wall, the blade
he had never thought to use again glittering in his hand.
Then he smiled, not altogether scornfully. His intention
was obvious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the ring now round him several other swords slid out.
Most of the guests, vociferating, had already made a bolt
for the door, but Rose was clinging to her husband in a
frenzy. “Georges! Georges! don’t let them do it! It
is the Duc, it is indeed! Tell them you had charge of
Mirabel—tell them .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” But her words, vain in any
case, could not penetrate the uproar. And, even as she
spoke, the officer of dragoons drew and cocked a pistol.
“Now, for the last time, Monsieur de Kersaint! See, we
do not want to harm your escort, if you have one—our
business is not with them—but if you drive us to use force,
you will certainly get them killed as well as yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His escort! that escort for the moment, mercifully, out
of hearing. In the imminent prospect of combat Gaston
had forgotten them. Good God, that was only too true—they
would certainly get themselves cut to pieces for
him! Roland—<span class='it'>Roland</span>!—and those other boys slaughtered
for his sake .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and uselessly! The idea was too horrible.
He must let them take him—quickly. His face
grew sombre, and he lowered his point a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this is the First Consul’s honour!” he said, but his
voice cut like a sword, “—and yours, soldiers and Frenchmen!
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>
I was warned of this—but I would not believe such
a thing possible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is orders!” a chorus answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swear that you will let my escort go unharmed—no,
how can I rely on your word?” he said, looking contemptuously
round, and this time no one answered him.
“At least I shall never give up my sword now, since there
is no one left worthy to receive it.” And before anyone
had moved he had put his left hand to the naked blade,
and, bending his knee, snapped the weapon across. Then he
threw the two halves at his feet and folded his arms. “I
am at your disposal .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>gentlemen</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only be quick
about it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had no desire to be other than speedy. There was
a travelling carriage just drawn up at the inn door; small
matter that it belonged to the Deputy who had tried to
interfere. Five minutes later, with fifty dragoons round it,
that carriage had started for Auray and Vannes, while the
remaining officers, having thrust aside the doubly infuriated
Camain, were dealing in the passage with the distracted
young men of their prisoner’s escort, to whom news of the
catastrophe had meanwhile penetrated. The short and
furious mêlée was indeed none of the Republicans’ seeking,
but its end was just as inevitable as if it had been.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
For Artamène, his head laid open by a sabre, having
stumbled, blinded with blood, into the eating-room, and
fallen his length among the tables, lay there without stirring;
while Lucien, his arm fractured, leant with shut eyes
against the doorpost, his uniform torn on one side from
shoulder to waist. And in the now emptied setting of the
drama which she had unwittingly brought about, Rose
Camain, kneeling by the bleeding and unconscious boy
on the floor, but not trying in any way to succour him, her
hands to the sides of her head in approved theatrical fashion,
was sending forth shriek after shriek.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>But Roland, uninjured though almost crazy, was in the
yard, his hands shaking so much as he re-saddled Zéphyr
that he could hardly pull the girths. Even so, he had
enough wits left to realise that the large stout man, himself
greatly discomposed, who had, as far as he remembered,
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>
dragged him bodily out of the affray, was right when he
said that it was perfectly useless to follow the vanished
carriage along the Auray road. The best thing that he
could do was to hasten back to Finistère and spread the
news. Roland was conscious that his adviser was helping
him now, keeping up, as he put on Zéphyr’s bridle, a
running accompaniment of wrath—“Disgraceful .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
infamous .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to purloin a carriage too.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, boy,” he said suddenly, throwing the reins
over the Arab’s neck, “—by the way, I suppose you’re his
son, are you not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland, too dazed and wretched to be surprised at the
idea, shook his head, and put his foot in the stirrup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re devilish like him,” said Camain explanatorily.
“Wait a minute—I want to say something. The Duchesse
de Trélan—if you see her, tell her she can command my
services. Camain, my name is; she knew me at Mirabel
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I expect you have heard about that. Hôtel du Lion
d’Or at Lorient will find me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland, in the saddle now, nodded. <span class='it'>O God, O God, they
had let him be taken!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see that your comrades are looked after,” added
the Deputy kindly, looking up at his young, desperate face.
“I hope it is all a mistake—damn it all, it must be! and
that they will release him when they get to Vannes. Yet
it is best not to count on it. Good luck to you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland bent down and seized the hand of the ex-administrator
of Mirabel, who so little divined in him the
“marauder” of last April, and next moment was out of
the courtyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even as he passed under the tunnel leading to the
street he heard this Camain calling after him, and impatiently
reined up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, young man,” said the Deputy in a lowered
tone, “as it was owing to my—as I feel a sort of interest
in the Trélan family, I’m damned if I don’t follow those
scoundrels to Vannes to-night, just to keep an eye on the
business. Tell the Duchesse that—and should she come
to Vannes in person, tell her to go to the Hôtel de l’Epée,
and if I am not still there myself I will leave a message
for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you!” said Roland, with tears in his eyes.
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span>
Then he was in the street, and a moment or two later,
riding like mad back along the road to Finistère.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some miles he galloped on almost without thought,
he was so numb with misery and incredulity. Zéphyr, the
incomparable, seemed quite fresh, despite the distance he
had come since yesterday morning. That was why he had
taken him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A rescue—how was it to be brought
about? It all seemed to rest on his shoulders. A terrible
feeling of helplessness began to wrap him round as he pushed
on through the cold rain which was now beating on him.
Was he really acting for the best in returning like this, and
what was to be done when he got back—the men all disbanded?
If only the Abbé were there! And how should
he ever tell the Duchesse? The clouds about him seemed
thick with the shame and anguish in his heart. And
Zéphyr was not so fresh after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What did they mean to do with the Duc? Hold him
as a hostage? They dared do nothing worse, in the face
of that full safe-conduct. Even the First Consul would not
dare. It was a mistake; yes, a piece of bravado. Yet if
only they had listened to M. de Brencourt!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had covered many miles without drawing rein. The
night was beginning, the early February night. And Zéphyr,
the tireless and surefooted, had stumbled twice. “O
Zéphyr, don’t you fail too, as we have failed!” cried his
rider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the border at last into Finistère, and through Quimperlé,
where they had slept yesterday. It was dark now,
and snowing a little. He meant to ride all night, but at
Bannalec it was plain that it was an impossibility both for
him and his gallant horse. He tried to get another; could
not, and fell asleep from exhaustion even as he argued about
it with the people of the inn. They carried him up and
put him to bed. He had covered not quite half of the
distance back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was afternoon of the next day when at last he got to
La Vergne, and he could hardly get out of the saddle, hardly
drag himself up the steps. No sentry now. He lifted the
great knocker; the door swung open. Someone had heard
the hoofs. It was Marthe. She caught at him as he
stumbled into the hall. “Roland, what is it? O, what
has happened?”
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad news,” said he, so weary he could scarcely frame
the words. “The Duc——” A cold mist suddenly drove
at him across the hall; when it cleared he saw Mme de la
Vergne hurrying towards him, and that Marthe had her
arms round him, half supporting him. And who was the
man rising from a chair by the hearth? But he saw also
the Duchesse de Trélan, who must have been coming down
the great staircase, standing as if turned to marble in her
descent, a few feet from the bottom.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And he broke
away from Marthe, for he knew he must tell her at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, they have arrested the Duc at Hennebont—they
have taken him to Vannes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was true about the
safe-conduct .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the others are hurt—killed, perhaps
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” And sobbing out, “How can we save him?”
clutching at her dress, he sank forward exhausted on the
stairs, his head against her very feet.
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span></p>

<h2 id='b4c8'>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>WHAT WAS LEARNT AT VANNES</h3>

<p class='noindent'>Two nights later, in the dark and the cold, they drove into
Vannes—Valentine, Roland and the Comte de Brencourt—having
left Mme de la Vergne at Hennebont as they passed
through, to tend her son. All thought of raising in Finistère
a force large enough for rescue had been abandoned.
Indeed they could never have got together enough men to
assault Vannes, held as it now was, and the mere attempt
might be extremely prejudicial to M. de Trélan. Since
Finistère had capitulated, it might indeed be the very consummation
at which the First Consul was aiming, in order to
have a good pretext for disposing of Finistère’s leader, now
that he had him in his hands. It was better to hurry to
Vannes and trust to organising a rescue by means of some
of Cadoudal’s Chouans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So M. de Brencourt had counselled when, the evening of
Roland’s arrival, he had offered Valentine such assistance
as a man still sick could give. That she could accept it
as she had done, and could show herself willing, in this
terrible hour, to rely whole-heartedly upon him, was balm to
his scarified pride. But indeed, in contemplating her despair,
he forgot, at moments, his reception by her husband.
If Artus de Brencourt had never arrived at seeing his own
past conduct in quite the same light as a dispassionate
observer would have done, there was one episode on which
he could not reflect without tingling shame and horror—that
frenzied vigil in which he had come near to slaying
in Valentine’s presence the man she loved. He had indeed
recognised for months past that he had been practically
out of his senses at the time—perhaps all the time since his
return from Mirabel.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not indeed that this knowledge
had helped him much that night at Vannes, in the struggle
he had had to bring himself to render a great service to the
man he had so deeply injured—apprehensive as he was
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span>
lest he should seem to be trying to make reparation, yet
forced to do the service in person for lack of a trustworthy
messenger. Well, it was certain that the Duc de Trélan had
not suspected him of <span class='it'>that</span> motive, when he had flung back
in his face the warning which the Comte had only been
driven to bring by the instinctive feeling that, despite
the past, he could not let his former leader go to his death
in such a shocking fashion. But the Duc had gone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and just because of the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no difficulty in obtaining news of “M. de
Kersaint” at Vannes. The place was ringing with it—and
it was stunning. He had been summarily tried the
day before by a military court, and sentenced to death.
The pretext was that he was an émigré a rebel taken in arms
who had never meant to surrender. He was to have been
shot that same afternoon, but at twelve o’clock had come
a courier with orders for a respite and for his immediate
transference to Paris. And, in half an hour from the
arrival of the despatch, he had been taken away in a
travelling-carriage under a strong escort. That was
yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much the Comte de Brencourt, quitting the conveyance,
easily gathered before they got to the Hotel de
l’Epée. He had to tell Valentine that her husband was
gone, but he suppressed the fact that, had he not been
removed, she would not have seen him alive; and hoped
she would not hear it. The lamp that lit the interior of
the carriage showed him, when he had finished his brief
recital, the tragic face of the woman he loved, on whom,
as if she had not known enough sorrow, this, too, was come.
But she did not weep nor blench; she said, “Then we must
follow to Paris to-morrow morning,” and he assented.
It would take them between three and four days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rattled through the dark and tortuous streets and
drew up at the hotel. Valentine put down her thick veil
and Roland assisted her to alight. Just inside the door
a large man was standing waiting—Georges Camain in
person. He came forward with an air of profound deference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have ventured to order a private room to be put at
your disposal, Madame,” he said, “and if you will allow
me, I will attend you there. I have a message for you.”
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have seen him then?” she breathed. And
Camain bent his head in assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will wait upon you afterwards,” murmured the
Comte in her ear. Since the Deputy had not recognised
him there was no point in giving him a further opportunity.
But Roland, obeying his gesture, followed Mme de Trélan;
yet after all, when the room was reached, remained outside
the door. So the ex-administrator of Mirabel and the
ex-concierge were once more alone together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment that she was inside Valentine threw back
her veil and turned to him. There was no need to utter
her question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I succeeded in seeing M. de Trélan for three minutes
yesterday,” said the Deputy gravely. “It was between
noon and half-past, when he left for Paris. I had been
trying in vain all morning to do so. And then, Madame,
the interview took place on the stairs as they were conducting
him to the carriage, so that it was not very satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But at least you saw him!” said Valentine, and the
emotion she was holding in check showed itself hungrily
for a moment. “O, if only I had been in your place!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I only wish you had, Madame,” returned
Camain gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you found him——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite well, Madame, and perfectly composed, though
I think the respite was a great surprise to him. You know,
I expect,” he went on, looking away for a second, “that
the iniquitous sentence was to have been carried out
yesterday afternoon?—Of course,” he added hastily,
for her face told him that she had not known, “this respite
has changed all that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As I say, we had only a moment
or two, and the letter which I understand M. le Duc would
have written to you, had this change not occurred, he had
not yet begun, so in that moment on the stairs he scribbled a
line on a page from my pocketbook, which he did me the
honour to commit to me, and I was to explain why it was
so short. I was also charged to ask you to convey to a
certain person who had brought a warning his profound
regret for the way he had received it, and to his aides-de-camp
an assurance that they were not to blame themselves
in any way for what happened at Hennebont; that since
his arrest was inevitable he wished it to take place without
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>
their knowledge, and that he was only grieved to hear that
in the end it had not done so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here is M. de Trélan’s
note, Madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put a tiny piece of paper in her hand, and, clearing
his throat, walked away to the fireplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine opened the little torn-off twist. It contained
only one word, and Gaston’s initials. The word was
“<span class='it'>Always</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pressed it to her lips. For a moment she seemed to
feel his arms about her. Ah, never again, perhaps.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
She murmured some words of thanks. The Deputy turned
round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to God I could have done more,” he said,
surreptitiously pocketing his handkerchief. “It is abominable—beyond
words—this affair! And to think that it
was brought about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he checked himself and looked
at her strangely, but she did not seem to notice anything,
and he went on, “Now, alas, I can do nothing further.
I have no influence with the present Government. I must
pursue my journey to Lorient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had done nothing but bring me this,” replied
Valentine, rousing herself, “a world of thanks would be no
payment. But you have shown me besides, Monsieur
Camain, the treasure of a kind and generous heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As long as you live, Duchesse,” said the bricklayer’s
son, bending over the hand she gave him, “you will not
lack that offering. It is your own heart that calls it
out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A little later the three travellers had made some pretence
of eating the meal which had been brought up to them,
and then, seeing that the two men were restless, Valentine
begged them not to consider her but to leave her if they
wished; and they, thinking on their side that she perhaps
desired to be alone, obeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine did desire to be alone, but it was no solace. It
seemed to her that she had touched the lowest depths of
human despair. She had never dreamt that Gaston would
be gone from Vannes. The word he had sent her was warm
in her bosom, but that was not he. She felt that it was
only the prospect of seeing him at the end of them, even
though it must be as a captive, which had kept life in her
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span>
these two dreadful days. And what had the Deputy said—that
if the <span class='it'>sursis</span> had not come .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O no, no, that was
not possible! She would not look at it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But it <span class='it'>was</span>
true that he was far away, alone, in the hands of his
enemies. It was an effort to keep herself from calling his
name aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat in a chair by the fire, the wind howling outside,
the tears dripping through her fingers, and did not hear the
door open. Roland stood on the threshold again, looking
at her with a great compassion and understanding in his
young eyes—for if his heart was broken what must hers
be? And half impulsively, half timidly, he went across
the little room and knelt down by her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, dear Madame!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still weeping, she put out her hand to him blindly, and
he kissed it, kissed her tears on it. And then she turned
wholly to him, and as he, kneeling there, took her tenderly
and reverently into his arms, she shook with sobbing on
his shoulder. It was really the first time that she had
broken down since the arrest. Except that he felt he must
comfort her—though he knew not by what means, for what
means were there?—the boy would have liked to sob too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said something, and through her misery she thought,
“His voice is getting like Gaston’s. There will be something
of Gaston left in the world after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at that moment that the impulse to tell him
came to her overwhelmingly. She was so lonely; it would
comfort her—if she could keep from thinking of Mme de
Céligny. He ought to know now, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She mastered her sobs after a while, lifted her head
from the boy’s shoulder, dried her eyes and leant back in
her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay there, Roland, if you will,” she said, and he sat
on the floor beside her chair, silently looking into the fire.
What he saw there was always the same—the inn parlour
at Hennebont; sometimes with his leader sitting there,
as he had last seen him when he went out to the others
on that thrice accursed errand of his own making, sometimes
disordered and sickeningly empty, as it had appeared
at his return.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine contemplated his face, quite haggard in the
firelight for all its youth, and the tragedy in his eyes.
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roland,” she said, putting her hand on his arm, “I
want to tell you something. The Duc sent a message to
you and the others through M. Camain. You were not,
he said, to distress yourself about what happened at
Hennebont, for as his arrest had to come he particularly
wished it should take place as quickly as possible, before
you could return. He knew quite well, you see, what you
would all have done—what you did, alas—and he would
not have you killed to no end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland turned that tragic gaze upon her. “In other
words, M. le Duc got himself taken to save us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>I wish
I were dead!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears were in his voice, not in his eyes, which were
quite dry. He turned them on the fire again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you then love him so much?” asked Valentine
softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland gave her one look; he did not answer in words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O my child, my child!” said Mme de Trélan. Her
beautiful and expressive voice held a world of meanings,
but Roland was back in the coals and the inn parlour. He
remembered they had not laid the four covers when he
went out of the room; there were only three—or was it
two? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If he had stayed, he could have died there at
his feet before they took him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roland,” said the Duchesse’s voice again, “I want to
tell you something else. I did not mean to do so yet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
but I feel I must.” She made a little pause. “You do not
remember your mother, I think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A long time ago, Roland .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she and the Duc met
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he loved her——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy turned, startled, from his contemplation of the
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—Too well,” finished Valentine, with a long breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went white, then scarlet; then white again.
“Madame—what do you mean?—I don’t understand.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You cannot mean——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unconsciously she was pressing her wet handkerchief
into a ball. “M. de Trélan is your father, Roland.”
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span></p>

<h2 id='b4c9'>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE RUBIES OF MIRABEL</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>“You really wish to do this, Madame?” asked Suzon Tessier,
looking at the piece of embroidery she had just laid
before the Duchesse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must do something, Suzon, to pass the time till I
start for the Temple. I cannot go out; Paris hurts me.
And, sewing once more in this room, I shall feel I am back
in the old days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only wish you were!” thought Suzon as she left the
room—a wish Valentine would never have echoed. Though
these days were nothing but linked hours of anguish and
suspense, she would not have changed. Heaven lay
between that time and this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day before yesterday she had arrived with her escort
in this new, gay, animated Paris which hurt her so—the
Paris which, exhilarated by a slight frost, under a cheerful
winter sky, seemed to have drunk in a new lease of life
with its revivifying change of government. It was a fresh
world to Valentine—and a cruel. So when, after one night
at a hotel, she had sought out Suzon to see how she fared,
that faithful soul had refused to let her face again the
curious looks of the hostelry. Since there was no danger
to Mme Tessier in housing her now—and Valentine had
learnt long since that the threatened Mirabel enquiry had
never come to anything—she let herself be persuaded
without much difficulty, and she and Roland were staying
in the Rue de Seine. M. de Brencourt was lodging at an
obscure little <span class='it'>hôtel garni</span> in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier.
Mme de Trélan had hardly seen him since their arrival; he
was too deeply occupied. For the whole weight of Royalist
influence in Paris was at work to procure the release of
“M. de Kersaint” from the prison of the Temple, where
he was in close confinement awaiting the First Consul’s
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>
pleasure. He was still under the sentence of death passed
on him at Vannes, and all attempts, based on the disgraceful
means taken for his capture, to get that sentence removed,
or even commuted, had so far been vain, though Berthier,
the Minister of War, was an officer of the ancien régime,
and Lebrun, the Third Consul, actually in relations with
the Royalist party. Protests and clamour having proved
unavailing, there remained therefore nothing, if the prisoner
was to be saved, but to carry him off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was by no means a hopeless enterprise, for in
Paris there existed a whole subterranean population of
Chouans and émigrés, of conspirators and dubious characters.
The heads of the secret Royalist agency, the
Chevalier de Coigny and the Baron Hyde de Neuville,
knew well where to put their hands on suitable instruments.
Plans were in fact already well forward for a very
promising scheme, to be put into force the following evening.
There would arrive at the prison of the Temple a carefully
forged order for M. de Trélan’s transference to some other
place of confinement; it would be brought by an officer,
and there would be a carriage and a considerable escort—enough
to impose on any jailor in the world. And, once
they had the captive out, they would make for the coast,
along the road to which relays would be in waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this Valentine knew, and it had, till an hour or so
ago, been the one thing which filled her mind. But the
arrival of the order to see her husband, which after reiterated
attempts had been procured for her, absorbed it
now. The order was for three o’clock that afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was more colour on Mme de Trélan’s face to-day
than at Vannes—more colour and more signs of strain. And
the sewing she had asked for was something of a pretence—as
much a pretence, really, as was Roland’s book, now
upside down on his knee where he sat on the window-seat,
his chin on his hand, gazing immovably out of the
window. She put down her needle and gazed at him in
her turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How like his profile was to Gaston’s—and how unlike!
Was she sorry that she had told him? It had changed
him, between that news and the catastrophe of Hennebont
he seemed a boy no longer. For a nature so open as his
he had said extraordinarily little, but she had divined
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span>
easily enough the tides of feeling that had met—were
meeting still—in his young heart: the shock of knowing
that he had no right to the name he bore (though since
he had been so carefully recognised by the late M. de
Céligny the world need never know that) the shock to his
thoughts of the mother of whom, perhaps mercifully, he
had no memory. On the other hand there was the fervour
of his worship for M. de Trélan, which lent so much reality
and poignancy to his frustrated desire to have died to
save him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She did not feel sure that she had not been
selfish in the matter; she had even said so, later on, that
dark evening at Vannes. But when he had cried bewildered,
“How can you be so good to me, Madame? You
ought to hate me!” she had answered that he must know
she loved him and was leaning on him then, or she would
never have told him. “But I think you ought to know,”
she had ended, “in case he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before she got further Roland had come back from the
mantelpiece, where his head lay buried in his arms, and
was at her feet, kissing the hands which were gripping
each other in the effort to finish that sentence. And he
said, in a smothered voice, “If it is dishonour .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do not
feel dishonoured.—But I cannot grasp it yet; it seems
too blinding .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine remembered all this, looking at him now after
six days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roland, my child,” she said suddenly, “I want to consult
you about something. If to-morrow night’s scheme
should fail——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man turned his head at once. “Oh, it will
not fail,” he asserted. “But I wish—O, how I wish—that
I were in it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For, there being secret communication between the
Royalist agency and the Temple, the prisoner had contrived
to express a strong desire that the Vicomte de Céligny
should take no active part in the plan of rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor boy, I know you do! But, Roland, I also have
to be inactive. Yet I have a scheme of my own, in case
the other fails .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know the Trélan rubies? We
had designed them, M. de Trélan and I, for Marthe on your
wedding day. Now I have the thought of giving—of offering—them
to someone else .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as a price.”
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“To whom?” asked Roland, leaning forward as the
Duchesse unclasped them from under her dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Mme Bonaparte.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland, a little startled, considered. “Would it be of
any use?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is said to be rapacious for jewels—and of Royalist
leanings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what could she do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Use her influence with her husband. What do you
think of it, Roland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man on the window seat reflected. “You
should consult M. Hyde de Neuville, Madame, not me. I
know nothing of Mme Bonaparte. But——” He stopped
and coloured a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, Roland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, Madame, but would the Duc approve of
such a step?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her own colour faded a little as she met his eyes. And
then with courage, she answered, “No, Roland, I am
afraid he might not. He is, as you know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very proud.
But it is not as if he personally would have a hand in it.
A wife’s mortal anxiety will excuse anything. I should go
as one woman—as one wife—to another .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an independent
step.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall you tell M. de Trélan of it this afternoon?”
asked Roland, with his eyes on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine did not answer for a moment. “But in that
case I could not say truthfully that he knew nothing of it—which
I should wish to be able to say. Advise me,
Roland!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Madame, how can I presume to advise you in a
matter that concerns only you and him. You know so
much better what he would wish than I do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Valentine sat silent, looking at him, her face drawn,
the red rivulet of fire across her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roland, what you really mean is that I know what he
would not wish!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Madame,” answered the boy in a very low
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine caught her underlip. “You have your father
in you, there is no doubt,” she thought to herself, and as
she bent over the stones a tear fell on to the possible price of
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>
blood. For the worst of it was that she knew Roland was
right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lifted her head again. “Then I shall speak of it
to him—ask his permission.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And I think, Roland,
that I will go and prepare now. It is very early to start,
but it is a long way to the Temple, and we could walk part
of it. It is so hard to sit still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she came downstairs again, dressed for the street, she
was thinking of the man who had put the rubies into her
hands that strange day at Mirabel. Ah, that the Abbé
Chassin were here now! he who had always been at hand
in difficulties, and who now, at the most critical time of all,
was over the sea. But even he, as she knew, could do no
more than was being done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the parlour she found M. de Brencourt—the first time
she had seen him that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are setting out already, Madame?” he asked,
bending over her hand. She told him why, thinking how
worn and ill he looked, and how possessed (as indeed he
was) by a spirit of restless energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would beg leave to escort you part of the way,” he
said, “but having missed Hyde de Neuville at his lodging,
and hearing he had something of importance to say to me
and was coming here, I must await him. Roland, I suppose,
accompanies you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—but he will not be able to see M. de Trélan, I am
afraid. Is there any message you wish conveyed about
to-morrow night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt shook his head. “Communications
of that kind, Madame, go by their own channel. Besides,
there is nothing fresh to say. The Duc knows the attempt
is to be made; his part is merely passive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said nothing for a moment. Then, flooding up
from the depths, came the thing she had not yet allowed to
escape her. “O, Monsieur de Brencourt, if only he had
listened to you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte shook his head. “No, Madame, say rather,
If only the warning had come from other lips! I was the
one man in the world who should not have carried it.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Duchesse, we cannot put off our past so easily; it
clings, like the shirt of fable, and poisons everything.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You may tell the Duc, if you will, that I accept his apology
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>
in the same spirit in which he sent it. I cannot blame him
for disbelieving my veracity—however much, being only
human, I resent it. But it was inevitable; and that he
is where he is now is Nemesis—the Nemesis I have drawn
down on both of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could find no words before the sadness of his tone.
He opened the door for her.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>When he had shut the door behind Mme de Trélan the
Comte turned and threw himself down in a chair, his chin
on his breast, staring into the fire. His brain was weary,
for he had been up most of the night. He could not
forget (even if Valentine did, as he sometimes suspected)
that the Duc de Trélan was not only a prisoner but a condemned
prisoner—not a man awaiting trial, but one already
under sentence of death—and that his position was very
precarious. Any hour might conceivably bring the tidings
that the sentence had been carried out on him; for his
own part he wished the rescue had been fixed for that
evening, but it had not proved possible to have every thread
in place so soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt’s whole soul was so set on getting Gaston
de Trélan out of the mortal peril in which he stood, that he
did not analyse his motives over closely. He had entered
on the attempt for Valentine’s sake—and a little, too, for
the sake of his own self-respect. And the Duc had sent a
message of regret; from him of all men that was no empty
form of words. Yet Artus de Brencourt was under the
impression that he cared very little about de Trélan’s fate
in itself. But it is hard to know one’s own heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on staring into the coals. He wished he did
not keep seeing that figure by the dolmen in the forest
waiting with folded arms to receive his fire. It was so very
possible .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He shivered. “How much better it would
be if I could take his place!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A knock, and the expected visitor was shown in, and
the Comte roused himself. Hyde de Neuville, the newcomer,
was surprisingly young for the position he occupied—only
three and twenty in fact—good-looking, alert,
intelligent, well-dressed, a man of good family accustomed
to the best society, and, in some of his activities, to the
<span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span>
worst. He had some astonishingly audacious exploits to
his name. When he wrote letters—as to M. Chassin—he
signed himself “Paul Berry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had gone to see Bertin,” explained the young man,
coming over to the fire. “I was fearing a hitch about the
escort. But it is all right. The two dozen men he had
laid his hand on are perfectly reliable, and I am now quite
satisfied. Uniforms, indeed, are more difficult to procure
than bodies to put them on. But we shall manage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have no doubts about the forged order?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the slightest. And none of the Temple officials
will be surprised, I think, if M. de Trélan is transferred,
the circumstances of his capture having been so exceptional.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So damnable!” interpolated the Comte.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I really wanted to speak to you about something
quite different,” went on the young conspirator. “Late
last night I had a communication from my compatriot
Bourgoing, who is in relations with Talleyrand. It appears
Talleyrand thinks that, partly owing to the outcry which
has been made about this abominable violation of M. de
Trélan’s safe-conduct, Bonaparte would, after all, be
rather glad to get out of going to the extremity to which
he most undoubtedly meant to go when he sent those
infamous orders to Brune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Brencourt stared at him rather incredulously. “I
can hardly believe that of the First Consul. He is entirely
without scruples, and very unlikely to be frightened into
turning back once he has started on a course, however black
that course may be. He cannot be magnanimous now;
it is too late. It would only look like weakness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that. But Bonaparte, besides getting rid
of the odium this affair is raising in certain quarters in
Paris, would demand some kind of <span class='it'>quid pro quo</span>—that the
Duc should personally ask for his life, and, I suppose, give
an undertaking never to conspire against him. Talleyrand
is almost convinced that in such a case he would be merciful—in
fact that he would secretly be relieved. He could
make at any rate some pretence of magnanimity; it might
affect wavering supporters. But he has gone too far to set
the Duc de Trélan free of his own motion; it would look
too much like weakness, as you say. On the other hand
<span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>
if it were publicly known that the Duc had asked for
mercy——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear, in that case, that the First Consul will not
obtain the relief which he desires,” observed M. de Brencourt
drily. “Who that had had any acquaintance with
him could imagine that the Duc de Trélan would, for any
consideration, stoop to sue from Bonaparte—and by so
doing serve Bonaparte’s purpose too! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I should
scarcely like even to propose such an idea to him.—But of
course it would be only proper to inform him—as I expect
you have already done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hyde de Neuville looked thoughtful. He nodded. “My
note must have reached him, by the usual channel, three
or four hours ago.—By the way, has the Duchesse started
for the Temple? I think her interview was for three
o’clock, was it not? I was wondering whether the ease
with which, in the end, the order was obtained, was due
to the idea that she might work on her husband if she
knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I am thankful that she does not know,” replied
the Comte rather hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that it would be of no use? Well, we must
then stake everything on to-morrow night’s affair, which
promises excellently.” He brought out a paper. “Now,
who of these do you think had best drive the carriage, and
who play the officer commanding the escort? And I have
not yet quite arranged about all the further relays.”</p>

<h3>(3)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>At that very moment Valentine, on Roland’s arm, had
just emerged from the Rue du Roule into the Rue Saint-Honoré,
whence they intended to take a fiacre to the Temple.
In that animated and busy street Roland was looking round
for a carriage when he suddenly exclaimed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, Madame, what is coming. Is it—it must be the
First Consul himself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine followed his eyes. From the direction of the
Tuileries was approaching, at a fast trot, a carriage with
an escort of mounted grenadiers. It came onwards in a
clatter of hoofs, and on its passage a roar of cheers went up
and hats were waved. Valentine felt a momentary dizziness,
and held Roland’s arm tightly. She was about
<span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span>
to see the master of France, the great general, the great
administrator, the genius with a marvellous brain, an
indomitable will, and a petty soul—the man who had her
husband’s life in his hand, to keep or to throw away. But
when the carriage was almost abreast she involuntarily
dropped Roland’s arm and drew herself up, the pride of a
long line firing her blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she saw, passing quickly, not, as she had expected,
a young hero in uniform, but, in a grey civilian overcoat,
the wide revers crossed closely over his chest, a little man
whose hollow temples and cheeks, and pallid yellowish
complexion, made him look at least ten years older than his
thirty years. Sombre and preoccupied, his head sunk on
his breast, he appeared almost indifferent to the plaudits
of the crowd, but chance, or something in her attitude, drew
his eyes in Valentine’s direction, and for one brief second
the Duchesse de Trélan sustained—and returned—the
singular and burning gaze of Napoleon Bonaparte. Then
he was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trembling a little, Mme de Trélan took the young man’s
arm again. She could not shake off the feeling that the
First Consul knew who she was, and that it was the question
of the Duc de Trélan’s fate which was absorbing his thoughts
just then. And he did not look as if he could be turned
from his purpose by any woman.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us get a carriage and go quickly, Roland,” she said
in a faint voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slow horse clanked dully along the interminable Rue
du Temple, till at last Valentine and Roland found themselves
standing before the columned entrance to the
Palace of the Temple, once the habitation of the Comte
d’Artois and, before him, of other princes of the blood,
such as Conti of amorous memory. And soon, formalities
over, they were walking, with a soldier as guide, across the
great courtyard with its encircling row of leafless trees,
towards the low façade. Except that this was day, and
not night, they saw just what the Royal Family had seen
when they were brought there captives on the 13th of
August, 1792, for the palace itself had not changed its
external aspect since, and the prison itself, the great
Tower, stood at some distance behind. Following their
guide they went through the building, emerging finally
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span>
on the flight of steps which led down from what had been
the great salon to the palace garden, and saw then, at the
end of the deserted pleasances, the great wall built round
the Tower to isolate the royal captives, and over its bleak
masonry the upper storeys and the pointed roof of the
massive donjon of the Temple which was their goal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine had heard of this wall of Palloy’s at the time
of its construction. It had served its purpose only too well
then; it looked—God help her!—as if it would serve it well
now. Yet M. de Brencourt had escaped—but that was by
bribery, and he had not been in solitary confinement.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Now they were at the guardhouse in the wall, were passed
civilly and quietly through, and found themselves facing
the fortress itself, grey, massive, foursquare, with its small
satellite round tower at each angle. Every window in the
main building, except those at the very top, was blinded
by a sloping board-work, a tabatière. And round it the
encircling wall, supported on many buttresses, formed a
complete square of desolation. In this were listlessly promenading
a few prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the entrance, Madame,” said their guide,
pointing to the left-hand of the two smaller towers on that
side. “The stairway runs up that tourelle; they will
take you up from the greffe there. I see old Bernard awaiting
you, in fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And indeed, on the small semi-circular perron at the foot
of the little tower was already standing an old gaoler with a
bunch of keys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame de Trélan?” said this old man when they
got there. “We were expecting you. If you will show
me the pass there is no need to go into the greffe. Thank
you, Monsieur .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Madame will be obliged to mount a
good many steps, since M. de Trélan, as she probably knows,
is in solitary confinement, and therefore at the top of the
Tower. I will go first; there are wickets to unfasten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The winding stairway of the turret was too narrow for
Roland to give the Duchesse his arm. Light and gloom
alternated with each other as they passed the slit-like windows
in the six-foot masonry. And every step they
mounted seemed to drive the blood further from Valentine’s
heart. How could Gaston ever be rescued, even by
guile, from a place like this? And she, who had been
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>
twice in prison herself, and thought she knew all its bitterness,
now found that she was tasting a cup incomparably
sharper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was so pale when they got to the top that Roland
put his arm about her for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trying, the ascent, Madame,” observed the melancholy
gaoler. “One hundred and twenty-two steps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A couple of sentries with fixed bayonets stood before the
thick, nail-studded door. The “Marquis de Kersaint”
was well guarded indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young gentleman will stay outside,” observed
Bernard. “My orders, as you know, are only for the
family. There is a bench yonder, Monsieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland, his heart beating furiously, bent his head in
acquiescence, and when the gaoler had unlocked the door
and the sentries had stood aside Valentine passed in alone.
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span></p>

<h2 id='b4c10'>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE LAST CONFLICT</h3>

<p class='noindent'>She had no time for thought of her surroundings. Gaston,
warned by the opening of the door, was waiting just inside,
and she was in his arms, strained to him, clinging to him,
before ever it had finished closing behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O, haven where she had thought these last dreadful
days never to rest again! But no, how could God take it
from her again so soon? He was too good! Just to be
there once more, to feel Gaston’s lips on hers, to hold him—the
agony of suspense drugged, if not dead—nothing else
mattered, not even that he was a prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beloved, your cheek is cold,” he murmured. “Is it
so cold in here?—and if I hold you all the time will you be
warm enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not cold,” she answered in a whisper, “but hold
me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hold me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” And consciousness of everything
but that hold drifted away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Cold? Perhaps <span class='it'>he</span> was cold—neglected? What
was this place like? To see it, in its relation to him, she
lifted her head from his breast, and was conscious for the
first time of the small, high room in which she stood, of the
window ten feet up in the wall, so that no view was possible,
and the light came down from it very cheerlessly. On the
ancient walls, blackened in places by the smoke of many a
bygone torch, names were scrawled. She saw a pallet, a
table and chair—and a stove, which was burning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she scrutinised him, with such eyes of anxiety for
what she might discover in his appearance that Gaston
smiled at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you expect to find, my darling, that ten days
of captivity can have changed me?” he asked. “I have
everything I want—everything I can pay for, that is—except
liberty for correspondence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and my personal
liberty, bien entendu.”
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed he looked younger, less worn, than at her last
sight of him. And his tone, assumed or natural, was so
calm. But somehow that very fact made her a little
uneasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her hands again. “Sit down, my heart. No,
not on my solitary chair; I cannot recommend it. The
bed is better; I can sit there too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She obeyed him. She did not like to think he slept on
that!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This place makes me shudder, Gaston.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest, after La Force and your other prison! It
seems to me, now that you are here, like a palace! And
you, what roof in Paris has the happiness of sheltering
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him. And then, holding his hand as he sat by her
on the little bed, and turning round and round on his finger,
for which it was now too loose, his emerald ring, she
approached the subject so near her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston, you spoke just now—not seriously, I know—of
paying for your liberty. Suppose this plan for your
rescue fails, which God forbid, but suppose it fails .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
could your liberty be bought?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her so hard, so questioningly, that her
hopes for the scheme sank lower still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear not,” he said very gravely. And then, after
another pause, “What did you imagine could buy it, my
wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And by his very intonation she knew that she would
never, with his consent, kneel to Joséphine Bonaparte. Yet
she would not give up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the ruby necklace,” she answered, and went on.
But he soon stopped her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Valentine, you cannot really be proposing that I should
stoop to beg my life of Bonaparte!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She winced, for the tone was almost hard, and hurt.
“No, no,” she interposed hastily, “not that <span class='it'>you</span> should!
But I, your wife, approaching Mme Bonaparte, a wife
herself, that is a very different thing. For me to do so
is a most natural step, and when I point out to her what
surely her husband cannot realise, the infamy of the means
by which he took you, the violation of your safe-conduct——”
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been staring at the floor, his mouth set. But
again he broke in. “The First Consul has had plenty of
time to reflect on that, Valentine. Believe me, he knows
what he is doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O, the place was cold, after all, deadly cold! And Gaston
so inexorable——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you will not let me——” she began once more
unsteadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A thousand times no! I forbid it absolutely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very low, Valentine said, “And what of me? Am I
too to be sacrificed to the pride of your race? Can I not
plead for myself, Gaston,—not with Bonaparte indeed,
but with you, with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned, he caught her quickly in his arms. “My
darling, my very dear, don’t say that!” he exclaimed in a
moved voice. “Don’t say that! It is not I indeed, nor
pride——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she retorted, half sobbing, “Gaston, I almost think
that if you were to be told you could have your life for the
asking, you would not ask for it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mercifully she could not guess that the sudden closer
tension of his arms about her told how her shot had
gone home, nor that her head almost rested at that moment
on Hyde de Neuville’s letter. As for Gaston himself,
who knew how truly, indeed, she had unwittingly spoken,
he dared not take up her challenge. So he said, as calmly
as he could, “My dearest, you are overwrought. And,
Valentine, can you think that I should allow you to put
yourself to a useless humiliation, you whom I love more
than my life? For I do not think Mme Bonaparte would
have any influence in the matter, and if she had, I dislike
the idea of bribing her to use it, as much as you do, I am
sure, in your heart. No, we will trust to that clever and
audacious young man, Hyde de Neuville, with all the
means he has at his disposal. To come and demand a
prisoner with a forged order and a fictitious escort will be
child’s play to him. And some day I will tell you the
very good reason I have for not wishing my life to be
begged by anyone. On the faith of a gentleman it is not
merely pride. But for the present you must trust me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present. He could speak of it like that! Then he
really thought that there might be a future in which he
<span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span>
would be a free man? Did he, <span class='it'>did</span> he? She looked hard
at him, and suddenly out of the past shot the remembrance
of that very different struggle which had ended their life
at Mirabel. Then she had pleaded with him to do something
worthy of himself; now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was it possible that she
was urging him to consent to something unworthy? If
that were so, thank God that he was, as before, unmoved.
And as she studied the fine, rather worn profile she realised,
too, how much less stern were the lines of his mouth. He
had asked a little while ago, in jest, if she thought his brief
captivity had changed him. But it was true; there was
a deep change in him. The profound depression of those
last days at La Vergne was gone. Why?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston,” she said on an impulse, “you are happier
than when we parted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his head, looked down into her eyes, and
smiled. “You can guess why, my soul—you who know
what was spared me. God was kind to me. The wine
was poured, but I did not drink it. I never had to give up
my sword; I never did consent to disarmament. And
Finistère is saved all the same. Have I not reason to be
happier?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet—O Gaston, Gaston, I must say it—if only
you had listened to M. de Brencourt’s warning!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up from the bed. “M. de Brencourt, I trust, has
received the message I sent by M. Camain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Valentine. “He sent one back by me
to-day; that he accepted your apology. But he said—and
it distressed me, Gaston—that he ought never to have
brought the message himself. Your disbelief, he seemed
to think, was his Nemesis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true,” said her husband a little coldly. “To
this hour I do not see how I could have believed in his
good faith. But—I have been wanting to say this to you,
my dearest—nothing could have made any difference.
You think that if I had listened to his warning I should not
be here to-day, nor those poor boys lying at Hennebont.
But as far as I am concerned it would have been just the
same. I must have gone to Vannes to give up my sword,
even were I sure that I was walking into a snare. For if,
scenting a trap, I had not gone, what would have happened?
Brune would have stoutly denied the intended
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span>
treachery, I should have been branded as failing to redeem
my pledge, and Finistère would have been invaded after
all. Do you not see that even if I had believed de Brencourt
I could have done no differently?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at him a moment, standing there with a
prison wall for background. No, <span class='it'>he</span> could have done no
differently, whatever a man with less strict a sense of
honour might have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are you!” she said proudly. “But I will point
out that aspect to the Comte—for he has suffered, Gaston.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But, my darling, there is something else I want to
ask you.” She paused a moment. “If you will not let
me beg your life, and I”—she faltered a little—“I accept
your wishes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what is to happen if the plan for to-morrow
fails? Will Bonaparte keep you in prison for years,
perhaps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the human spirit has such strange recesses that it
really seemed to her that by throwing out this suggestion
in words she could make it real, avoid a worse. For at
Vannes they had told her——</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston de Trélan went suddenly over to the stove, and
held out his hands for a moment to its warmth. His back
was towards her. Then, sitting down beside her on the
bed again, he said lightly, “He is not likely to have the
chance of doing that—unless he captures me a second time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw that he was evading her. “Yes,” she broke in,
seizing his arm, “I know; we have spoken about that.
But the best plans sometimes fail. What then? Gaston,
as you love me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gaston, answer me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked down at the little hand gripping his arm, and
after a moment put his other hand over it. “My wife,
can you not see that the First Consul, a soldier himself,
would not incur the odium of an almost unparalleled piece
of military treachery unless it were worth his while? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
My dear, there is no braver woman than you. I do you
the honour, therefore, of telling you the truth. No, he
will not keep me in prison. If I am not rescued I shall
undoubtedly be shot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as an—example.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was answered. Her hand relaxed upon his arm,
and he hastily slipped the arm itself about her as she
fell away from him. But Valentine pulled herself still
further away.
<span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I am going to disregard your wishes, Gaston!
You do not know what you are saying. I give you fair
warning. I am going to Mme Bonaparte—to the First
Consul himself! You expect me to stand by and see
you murdered when I might save you! What is your
pride—which you cannot deny—against your life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
Gaston, Gaston, against my love for you, which you treat
so lightly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slipped to his knees and caught her hands to his
breast. “O, my more than dear, do not say that!” he
implored. “Is not your love for me all the light I have
in the world? But at this hour there is something that
calls more insistently even than love—something that, if it
has to do with pride, is not linked with personal pride. I
mean—honour. And you could not gain me my life if
you asked—I am sure of it—yet if you were to make the
attempt——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Valentine broke in with desperate logic. “You cannot
know that I should fail! How could you? You cannot
be sure till it has been tried. And I shall try! Then
you can talk of failure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston knelt there as pale as she. Surely, surely,
he could find some way to stay her without revealing the
cruel knowledge he had—that only he himself could ever be
successful in an entreaty which even she could not move
him to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Valentine, sooner than think of you on your knees to
that man I would go on my own—if that were conceivable.
But it is not conceivable—not if he had a pardon ready
sealed in his hand, not if he held it out to me! Think a
moment, heart of my heart, and face it! When did any
captured Breton or Vendean, even the humblest peasant,
ever ask for mercy? Thousands of them have laid down
their lives readily in the cause they fought for, and hundreds
of gentlemen, too. And would you have me—through
your mouth or my own it matters little—would you have
me, a leader, be the first in either of those lists to play the
recreant? Was it for that you wrought and gave me
that scarf there—that when the crucial moment came I
should deal the cause it represents such a stab in the back as
my humiliation would be? Think of our enemies saying,
‘At the last moment the Duc de Trélan’s heart failed him,
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span>
and he humbly besought the First Consul for his life.’ How
would that sound in the streets of Paris next week .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and when the King comes back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine flinched. Her lips were grey. Indeed she
did not like the sound of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Gaston,” she said, those lips quivering, “for the
cause you have done more than enough. You have done
everything that mortal man could do, you, the last in
arms—more than Cadoudal, who was so strong—more than
all the rest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And all in vain,” he finished sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No devotion is in vain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled suddenly, the smile, somehow, of a young
man. “My darling, that is what I have been trying to say.
There are two sides to being made an ‘example’ of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at that she gave a sharp exclamation and put her
hands over her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband’s face became still more drawn. “Valentine,”
he said tenderly, but very gravely, “have you
forgotten the night I came, when the tide of fortune was
ebbing, to La Vergne. It was your name day; not three
weeks have passed since then. That night, my very dear,
my heart of hearts, my fleur-de-lys, you understood—wonderfully—and
you gave me leave to die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not like this—not like this!” she cried distractedly.
“O blessed saints, help me! Why did I ever say that!
I meant—in the fighting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I thought the need for
it was past with the surrender. O Gaston, Gaston, you
are killing me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed it seemed like it. Her head went down to her
very knees, and the wrenching sobs shook her from head to
foot. The price was more than she could pay! He was
now, through and through, what once she would almost
have given her soul to see him. But the cost, the cost of
it! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She saw, dimly, horribly, what he meant—the
damage his death would do to Bonaparte’s reputation. It
broke her, strong as she was. And, no longer rebellious
but purely suppliant, she threw herself on his neck as he
knelt there beside the little prison bed, pleaded with him,
besought him, implored him—and all in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It almost broke Gaston too, since for him there was also
the strain of keeping from her any suspicion of what he
<span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span>
knew about Bonaparte’s real desire, but his man’s, his
soldier’s will held firm against the lover’s. Extravagant
perhaps, even fanatical, but none could say ignoble, his
intention was fixed. If the attempt at rescue failed, if
the First Consul meant to consummate his treachery, he
must do it. There was no more to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the end Valentine was, if not acquiescent, at least
vanquished. No, she would not go to Mme Bonaparte;
she gave him her word. No, she would not even lend
the countenance of her name to any of the protests now
being made in certain quarters. Yes, she would even
acknowledge that, theoretically, he was right.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Beaten
and shivering, she half lay in his arms, and composure, the
composure of exhaustion, began to come back to them
both after the combat, and for a little while they were able
to talk of other things, far away and dear.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A warning knock came at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” exclaimed Gaston, “is the time nearly up,
then? And we have spent so much of it in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. conflict!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her with eyes full of love and a very white
smile on his lips. And all Valentine’s soul was in the
gaze with which she met his in her answer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me for my foolishness! It is over now. I
would not have you otherwise than victor—for now I see
you at your full stature. And I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who once presumed
to criticise you—I am at your feet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in worship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice died out of existence under his sudden passionate
kisses. His own was shaking as he said between
them, almost fiercely, “You must not say that, Valentine,
you must not say that! O my dear, my dear, how <span class='it'>can</span> we
part, how can I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knock came once more. He stopped abruptly, set
his teeth, loosed the tension of his hold, and after a second
or two stood up, quite steady and composed again, drawing
her gently with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who brought you here, my darling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roland,” she answered. “He is waiting out there all
this while, poor boy. And, Gaston, he is heartbroken.
He thinks they ought all to have been killed before they
let you be taken. Not even the message you sent him at
Vannes seems to comfort him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston sighed. “Poor Roland! And he is just outside?
<span class='pageno' title='406' id='Page_406'></span>
Cannot he come in for a moment? Surely, Valentine,
I am absolved now from my promise to de Carné.
I should like to tell him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My heart, he knows, these seven days. I told him at
Vannes. <span class='it'>I</span> had made no promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you!” said her husband, raising her hand
to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaston, ask to see him,” she suggested. “The pass
was for one or more members of the family. Tell the gaoler
that he is your son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would allow that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should wish it. It is the only way to see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My saint!” He kissed her hand again. “Very well.
Old Bernard is an excellent soul; he will not be particular
to a minute or two. But do not go, my darling! I want
yours to be the last presence in this room to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Valentine shook her head with a little smile.
“These are his moments. I will come back afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One long embrace and they separated as the door swung
open. Outside could be heard the click of steel as the
sentries crossed their bayonets over the aperture. But,
before Valentine going out, they uncrossed for a second.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to see the Vicomte de Céligny for a
minute or two,” said Gaston to the gaoler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only members of the family, Monseigneur,” returned
the precise old man, shaking his head. “I have very
strict orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But since he is my son!” retorted M. de Trélan, in the
most natural tone possible. “Come,” he went on, as the
old man looked incredulous, “you are sufficiently old-fashioned
to call me Monseigneur, and yet you affect not
to know that the son of a duke rarely bears the same title as
his father. Besides, if you doubt me, go and look at him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said old Bernard, “if he is your son the
order covers him, though his name is not on it. You swear
that he is your son, Monsieur le Duc?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I swear it,” answered Gaston.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a strange person and place to receive the first
public avowal of his relationship to Roland! He leant
against the table and put his hand over his eyes, for indeed
the victory he had won in the last hour was only less
<span class='pageno' title='407' id='Page_407'></span>
prostrating than a defeat. When he removed it, Roland
was through the door, was on one knee before him, trying
to seize his hand and kiss it, and half sobbing out the old
appellation, “Monsieur le Marquis! Monsieur le Marquis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston stooped and raised him. “Am I only that to
you, Roland, my son, my son!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, actually in his father’s arms, the warring tides of
emotion in the boy’s breast were stilled. He hid his face
there, trembling a little. But Gaston said never a word
till he took his son’s head between his hands and lifted it.
“You are like your mother,” he said in a low voice, looking
into his eyes. “You may think of me as you like, Roland,
but of her you must think as you have always done. The
blame was mine, and mine alone.” And he kissed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his hero’s kiss on his forehead, Roland was in no
state to apportion blame between that hero in his mortal
peril, and the mother whom he did not remember. He
drew a long breath and said, “If only I can be what your
son ought to be, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston smiled rather sadly. “Take a better example, my
child. But there is one way in which you can—no, I think I
have really no need to point it out to you. If I am shot,
Mme de Trélan——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland clutched his arm. “Don’t use that word, sir—I
cannot bear it! For it is our fault, all this—we failed
you! And we had hoped to die with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear boy, that was just what I did not want—and
you must allow your general some say in the matter.
That was why I hoped the business would be quickly over,
and why I was so much distressed to hear from M. Camain
what happened after I was gone. You have no further
news of the others yet, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland shook his head. “But it was thought, when
we passed through Hennebont, that Artamène would
eventually recover, though he was too ill to know us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Monsieur le Duc, I have never understood why it happened
just at that moment—your arrest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, directly after you left the room, Roland, I
was recognised by a woman whom I had once known
slightly. The comedy was that I failed to recognise her
at the time—though I have realised since who she was—and
that she had no idea, poor soul, of what she was bringing
<span class='pageno' title='408' id='Page_408'></span>
on me. But it made no difference; they would have
taken me at Auray, if not at Hennebont; even if I <span class='it'>had</span>
reached Vannes a free man I should not long have remained
so. That came out very clearly at my—trial. So you see
there is nothing to be distressed about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Roland thought otherwise. Had the arrest been
attempted on the highroad there would have been a chance
which there never had been in that trap of a room. He
had a vision of a great fight in the open, in which they three
should have laid down their lives indeed, and their leader
spurred away, free. He sighed disconsolately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mme de Trélan spoke of going to Mme Bonaparte,” he
remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not sanction it,” said his father quietly.
“Besides, it would be useless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean,” said Roland, biting his lips to keep back
certain unmanly evidences of emotion, “that you are
sure the First Consul is absolutely determined to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston did not answer for a moment. Then he took a
letter out of his coat. “No,” he said quietly, “as it happens
that is just what I do not mean. On the contrary.
For a person of his extreme decision he appears to be
uncomfortable. Read that, Roland; but first give me
your word that you will not tell the Duchesse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I give you my word, sir—as your son,” said Roland,
throwing back his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he read it some colour came back to his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God! Then, Mon——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mon père, I hope you were going to say,” interposed
M. de Trélan smiling, as he took the letter from his suddenly
shaking hand and tore it across. “No, my son, there are
some things that one does not do, and one is, to play, in a
situation such as mine, the enemy’s game. You see from
that letter what—as far as any mortal can penetrate into
his heart—the First Consul would like to happen—and
therefore, quite plainly, it is just what shall not happen.
Either he must release me of his own act, unconditionally—a
step which is extremely improbable—or he must go on
to the end. That end he will regret .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for his own
sake.” He opened the door of the stove, and threw in the
paper. “I have shown you that letter, Roland,” he went
on, turning to him again, “because you are a man now,
<span class='pageno' title='409' id='Page_409'></span>
but I have particularly kept the knowledge of what it says
from the Duchesse; still more must it be kept from her if I
die. It would make it too hard for her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you understand?
I fear I have made it hard enough as it is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You can tell her, if you like, some day—years hence.
And I want you to warn the Comte de Brencourt and
M. Hyde de Neuville not to let her know on any account—if
I die, that is. If I escape, it is of no consequence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you escape!” cried Roland feverishly, “but you
shall escape! That plan—if only I might take part in it!
But Mon—mon père, I have been thinking out there .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I am not so tall as you, but since I am like you a little
(though I never knew it), if you would but get into my
clothes now and go away with Mme de Trélan while I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dearest boy,” said Gaston, touched and laughing
too, as he put his arm round his shoulders, “that thousand-year-old
device! As if I could pass for a young man of
twenty! Alas, never again! But I have every confidence
in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the official scheme for to-morrow evening. Yet
in case——” He slipped the emerald ring with the phoenix
off his finger and put it on Roland’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A quiver ran through the boy. He clasped the hand
thus decorated to his breast as though it were wounded.
“Then you have not every confidence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O mon père,
take it back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will take it back when I am free,” replied his father,
smiling. “A loan, you see.—Here is my patient Bernard.”
He took him in his arms and kissed him on either cheek.
“Be happy with Marthe—she shall wear the rubies after all.
And try to get your grandfather, some day, to think less
hardly of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roland, shaking with the sobs he was striving so hard
to suppress, said almost inaudibly, “But he does. I have
had a letter. He is greatly distressed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I have gained something by being sentenced to
death,” thought Gaston to himself, with a rather grim
amusement. “You must go, my boy,” he said aloud.
“And God go with you, always!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched his son walk, blind with tears, to the door,
and then made a sign to the gaoler. “Give us one last
moment, Bernard, for pity’s sake!” For, before the
bayonets could cross themselves again, Valentine had
<span class='pageno' title='410' id='Page_410'></span>
slipped in, and come straight into his arms where he stood
under that heartbreaking window. And Bernard compassionately
went out again and closed the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the plan fails, Gaston, is this the last time?” (How
could anyone who was so white speak so steadily?)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no—they will certainly let me see you again.”
His own voice was not quite steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sure? I—a woman does not know about
these things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am sure of it. If it comes to that, I shall have
you in my arms once again, my dearest, dearest heart!”
Yet he held her now as if that time had come. “Moreover,
I do not believe the plan will fail. But, my
darling, I have not been torturing you unnecessarily,
in speaking of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the other alternative. It is only
because, as God has given us at the end of summer to be
one in life, I want you to understand that to die now
would be to me no defeat or loss—to understand so that
we might still be one .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even if we had to part.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death could never take you from me,” she answered.
<span class='pageno' title='411' id='Page_411'></span></p>

<h2 id='b4c11'>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>GASTON GIVES UP THE YELLOW POPPY</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>It was about six o’clock the next morning that old Bernard,
who had just finished dressing himself, looked out of the
window of the little ground-floor room in the Palace of the
Temple where he slept—for most of the personnel of the
prison were housed there, and he indeed, a former servant
of the Prince de Conti, had slept there for more years
than he could count. The pale, reluctant winter dawn
was on the courtyard and its shivering trees. It would be
a chilly transit to his duties in the Tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he was turning away, blowing on his fingers, he
heard unusual sounds in the courtyard, and, after another
glance through the window, he went out on to the perron
and stood there in some astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A closed carriage—a berline—had just drawn in under
the entrance and was coming to a standstill in the middle
of the court. Immediately behind, with a great jangle of
bits and trappings, came riding two and two a score or so
of hussars. What on earth could this portend, at so early
an hour? It must be something official, however, since the
guard at the entry had admitted the cortège.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as Bernard stood there he heard himself hailed, and
saw the sergeant of the guard running towards him and
trying to attract his attention. A little behind him rode
an officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holà, Bernard!” called out the sergeant. “You are
just the man I want. Take M. le Capitaine Guibert to the
Tower at once; he brings orders for the immediate transference
of a prisoner. Here, mon Capitaine, is the very
gaoler who has the care of those au secret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer dismounted without a word, threw the speaker
the reins, and strode up the five steps to where the surprised
old man awaited him. He was young, tall and handsome,
<span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>
suitable in every way to the bravery of his sky-blue pelisse
heavily barred with silver, the fur-edged dolman of darker
blue that hung from one shoulder, and the gaily embroidered
sabretache that swung against his leg. But under the high,
cord-wreathed shako his face looked impenetrably, almost
unnaturally grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will come this way, sir,” said Bernard a little
nervously, and thereafter trotted along in front of him
through the palace and the length of its frosty garden,
perturbed in spirit, while the officer stalked behind him
equally silent. They passed the guardhouse in the wall
without comment. At the <span class='it'>greffe</span> in the Tower itself the
hussar, with the same economy of language, presented
an order, and said he wished to see the prisoner in question
immediately. The <span class='it'>guichetier</span>, having read it through, raised
his eyebrows, pursed his lips and transcribed it carefully
in a book. It was an order for the delivery of the person of
Gaston de Saint-Chamans, ex-Duc de Trélan, known also
as the Marquis de Kersaint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. de Trélan is au secret—I expect you know that,
captain,” he remarked when he had finished. “I hope
there has been no dissatisfaction at the Tuileries? I assure
you that every precaution is taken for his safe custody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young officer made a gesture that might have meant
anything, and prepared to follow his guide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To mount that dark, winding staircase on a winter’s
morning required a light. Bernard produced a torch and
preceded the officer, whose sabre clanked on the steps as
he followed him. Half way up, at one of the wickets,
the old man paused, and turned to him. “You are taking
away our most distinguished prisoner, Monsieur le Capitaine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied the hussar. His mouth shut as if he did
not intend to say more, and the old man went on again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One sentry—they were of a corps of veterans—was plainly
asleep, on the bench by the door, when they got up. His
companion, pacing to and fro, shoved him with his foot,
and he stood sleepily to attention as the officer passed.
In another moment the nail-studded door stood open,
and the young hussar, taking the torch from Bernard and
motioning him back, went in, pushing the door to behind
him.
<span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The torch he held, conflicting with the daylight from the
high window, showed him the man he had come for fast
asleep on the little bed in the furthest corner. He went
over to him, stood looking down at him a second or two,
and then, with what looked like hesitation, put out a hand
to wake him. But at that moment, roused by the light,
the prisoner stirred.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston had dreamt much that night, dreams commingled
of sweet and sinister. Nearly always the menhirs had
been in them, the Allée des Vieilles where Valentine had
been miraculously restored to him, but they were strangely
mixed with visions of Mirabel, where he and she had parted.
He stood once more among the old stones, but she was not
there; he was to meet her, he knew, at Mirabel, and the idea
was sweet. Yet somehow the dream was sinister.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now—he was fully awake on the instant, in the
fashion of a soldier and a commander. His first thought
was—Hyde de Neuville .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they had put forward the
time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. here was the pseudo-Republican officer he was
to expect. He looked up at the hussar for a second or
two—and all that fell away from him for ever. A man in
peril is swift of apprehension. This officer was genuine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are an early visitor, sir,” he said, raising himself
on his elbow. “I may guess, may I not, that you do not
come at this hour on any very agreeable errand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General,” said the young man, speaking at length
for the first time since he had entered the prison, “my
errand is hateful. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am ashamed of the uniform
I wear—but as long as I wear it I must obey.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Will
you read that, Monsieur le Duc?” He held out, not the
order he had shown to the <span class='it'>guichetier</span>, but another, and
brought the torch a little nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston took the paper, and, still leaning on one elbow,
studied it, and the vehement “Bonaparte” at the bottom,
with the marks of the splutter of the pen. His eyebrows
went up a trifle, but no other change came over his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little sudden,” he observed. “But after all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
What time do you wish me to be ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At seven o’clock, General. It is now ten minutes after
six.”
<span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duc de Trélan returned the warrant. “The First
Consul is somewhat given to sudden impulses,” he remarked.
“As he grows older he will find that they are
generally to be regretted. But I think that, after all,
I misjudge him; for this was intended from the first. I
have about fifty minutes then. Would you be so good,
Monsieur, as to see if they could find me a priest while I
am dressing; there may be one in captivity in the Temple.—No,
do not give yourself the trouble; if old Bernard is
there I will ask him myself. And you, Monsieur le Capitaine—shall
I see you again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I command the escort,” replied the young hussar,
looking away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be ready for you then, in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. forty-seven
minutes,” said the Duc, his eyes on the watch he had
drawn from beneath his pillow. “Perhaps you will be
good enough to leave me your torch for the moment. The
oil was finished in my lamp last night, and the illumination
here is not very good, as you can see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young officer looked round, saw a ring designed for
that purpose on the wall, thrust the torch into it, drew
himself up, made the captive a magnificent salute, and
strode to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next moment the old gaoler looked in, mildly curious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Bernard,” said the Duc, who was now sitting
on the edge of the bed, “I have a particular favour to ask
you. Can you contrive to heat me some shaving water
within a quarter of an hour or so? I wish to be presentable
this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But certainly, only—Monsieur le Duc, what is it, so
early? You are being transferred, I gathered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Bernard—if you like to put it so. And besides
the shaving water—and a better light to use it by—is there
by chance a priest among the prisoners here, think you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A priest!” exclaimed the old man, taken aback. “A
priest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t know—I don’t think so. But why
do you want a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O Monseigneur!—it’s not <span class='it'>that</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is indeed,” said Gaston with a little smile. “Not
altogether unexpected, my good Bernard.—Well, do your
best to get me a priest. I have not much time; only
about three-quarters of an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, he had not much time. And perhaps it was best.
<span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span>
He could not possibly say good-bye to Valentine now.
Yesterday had been their farewell after all. Did this
hurried execution mean that the First Consul had got
wind of to-night’s rescue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dressed swiftly, but with attention to details, shaved
with care when old Bernard, almost weeping, brought him
the water and the tidings that no priest could so far be
found; and, with only twenty-five minutes left, sat down to
write his last letter to Valentine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no little to say, but he wrote steadily and without
difficulty, pausing only once or twice. When he had
finished he took out from a pocket-case in his breast a little
square of folded paper, somewhat worn, wrote on it three
words and slipped it inside his letter. Then he folded,
addressed and sealed the whole, kissed his wife’s name
upon the superscription, and put it in the case. There
was already another letter there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, since he had taken from its place over his heart
the amulet he always wore there, to give it back to the
hand whence he had it, for the short time that heart had
to beat it should beat against the symbol that was rather of
loyalty than of love—but which love had nevertheless
fashioned and given him. He took from the back of the
chair the scarf he had so treasured, and put the end with
the golden fleur-de-lys to his lips. For a moment, at the
touch of what her fingers had wrought, a wave of anguish
engulfed him. He gripped his hands hard behind his
head, as it fell forward on the folds of the scarf across the
table. O, not to have to leave her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even to see her
once more, only once!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was short, that agony. Gaston de Trélan had faced
it many times these last few days. He rose, fastening the
scarf across his breast instead of as usual round his
waist. Her arms would be about him thus, to the
end. Only four minutes more. No priest had come.
So he knelt down by the table, and tried to collect his
thoughts.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened slowly. Gaston stood up; the young
hussar, much the paler of the two, came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am ready,” said the Duc. “But before we go I have
a favour to ask of you. This case, Monsieur, contains a
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>
letter to my wife, with another to the same address. Could
it be given to her? She is to be found at Mme Tessier’s
in the Rue de Seine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I give you my word that she shall have it,” said the
officer. “I will take it myself—if I cannot find a better
messenger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Monsieur,” said Gaston, replacing the
case inside his uniform. “If it will not inconvenience
you, however, I will keep the letter on me till the last
possible moment, and give it to you—later on. And I have
a fancy not to be parted from my Cross of Maria Theresa
before I need; therefore, if it would not be putting you
to too much trouble, I would ask you to take it off when
the business is over. This scarf I should wish to be buried
with. I am still, you know, Monsieur le Capitaine,” he
threw back his head a little, “the General commanding for
His Majesty King Louis XVIII. in Finistère, a position
that is not cancelled by my capture under a safe-conduct.—I
beg your pardon, for you neither had part in, nor
approve of that,” he added, seeing the young man wince.
“The scarf, then, I should desire to remain on me, the
order to go to the Duchesse if you would be so good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She shall have it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if you think that a Republican’s
word is ever to be trusted again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that I can trust yours,” retorted Gaston,
holding out his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur le Duc .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” stammered the young hussar,
hesitating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The keen eyes smiled at him. “My boy, do you think
I don’t understand? Come, we have a journey to make in
company. And your hands are clean—as I hope mine are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, with a flush, Captain Guibert gripped his prisoner’s
fingers for a second. And then old Bernard’s voice broke
in on them. “Monseigneur,” it said at Gaston’s elbow,
“you are fasting, and it is so cold outside! Will you not?”
And he held out on a little tray a cup of coffee. But
his hands shook so that the cup was clattering on its saucer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Bernard, you are my good angel,” said
Gaston gaily, as he took it from him. “I hope M. le Capitaine
was as fortunate before he set out—so much earlier,
too, than I am to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drank down the hot coffee and set the empty cup on
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span>
the table in significant proximity to his purse, which
he had already placed there for the old gaoler. But
Bernard, sniffing, shuffled out before he could take farewell
of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Bernard is too tenderhearted for his post,”
observed his prisoner. “The sooner he is quit of us the
better.—I follow you, Monsieur.”</p>

<h3>(3)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>A guard of dismounted hussars was awaiting them at the
foot of the Tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a carriage for you, Monsieur le Duc,” explained
Captain Guibert half apologetically, as, on a sign from him,
his men fell in behind him and his prisoner, “but it is in the
courtyard of the Palace, for as you know, it is impossible
for a vehicle to be brought any nearer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why should I wish for better treatment than my
King?” asked the Duc de Trélan. “He had to walk from
the Tower.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once through the great wall of isolation—at last—they
went side by side in silence, the armed guard behind, across
the garden to the Palace. Gaston was thinking that if,
on their way to the Plaine de Grenelle—the usual spot for
such events—they crossed the river by the Pont Neuf, as
was most likely, they could hardly avoid passing one end
or other of the Rue de Seine, where Valentine lay asleep,
or wakeful. He wondered whether she would somehow be
aware .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and whether he could entirely keep his composure
as they went so near.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they came, through the building, in sight of the
courtyard, the carriage was drawn up at the foot of the
steps. Grouped round it, the remaining hussars sat their
horses motionless, holding those of their dismounted comrades,
but the frost in the air made the animals impatient,
and one perpetual jingle shook from their tossing heads,
while their breaths, and the men’s, too, went up like
smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston looked back over his shoulder for an instant.
Above the low façade of the Palace, to the left of the
Tower behind, the sun was now visible, huge and red.
It would be a fine day, probably—but one would not
know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The dismounted men were already resuming
<span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span>
their saddles; a horse was pawing the ground as if eager to
be off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lieutenant Soyer,” said the captain, “take the head
of the escort!” He turned to his prisoner. “Monsieur de
Trélan, pardon me, but someone must drive in the carriage
with you. I am very sorry .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but if you will permit
me, I will do so myself, instead of my lieutenant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reminded Gaston of his own three ‘jeunes.’ In such
circumstances he would not have wished Roland to carry
himself otherwise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should desire your company, Monsieur le Capitaine,”
he replied courteously, and put his foot on the step of the
high-slung berline. “We journey to the Plaine de Grenelle,
I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man dropped his eyes and reddened. “No,”
he said, in a low, ashamed voice, “the orders are .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='it'>Mirabel</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time since he had learnt that he was to die
that morning, Gaston de Trélan showed emotion before a
witness. He flushed too, but it was with anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The First Consul’s idea of the dramatic, I suppose!
One sees his origin.” He bit his lip and recovered himself.
“I have the right, I think, to consider it somewhat misplaced.
However, the setting of the last scene is really of
small importance to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got into the carriage, and the captain of hussars
silently followed him in, and sat down opposite him, his
sabre across his knees. In a few seconds the carriage was
rolling noisily over the cobblestones of the archway into
the street. But they would not pass near Valentine now;
they would soon be going further away every moment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had traversed Paris, and were in the Avenue de
Neuilly, when the young officer said abruptly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur le Duc, if when we are past Neuilly, I were
to get out, to halt the escort, make some diversion, and
call off the men on either side if you could slip out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston shook his head, smiling, despite himself, at the
wild idea. “My dear boy—apart from a personal preference
for not being shot in the back—do you suppose that
I would accept your young life for mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My life! But my career was my life—and I am going
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>
to resign my commission before this day is over! I cannot
serve any more a soldier who violates a safe-conduct. And
I thought him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was with him in Italy—at Acre—at
Aboukir .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He put his forehead down on the hands
that rested over each other on the hilt of his sabre, upright
between his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston’s face softened as he looked at him. It was as
he thought. He would not have died in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leant back with folded arms. The rumble of the
wheels, the trot of the horses on either hand, the figures
of their riders as they rose and fell close to the carriage
windows, held a rhythm that was almost soothing. And
now that the shock of indignation and disgust was over,
what better place at which to die than Mirabel, which
had re-united him and Valentine? It was his dream come
true; he was not going away from her; she was—was she
not?—waiting for him there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only just this side of death had they plucked the flower
of flowers; but they <span class='it'>had</span> plucked it. And the life whose
uselessness had hurt her so, at the end he had contrived to
do something with it after all. By refusing to ransom it,
as he might conceivably have done, he was flinging it down,
not as a forfeit, but as a challenge, against the walls that
had been his and Valentine’s. In having him shot in
defiance of the strictest article of military honour, Bonaparte
plainly designed to make of the Duc de Trélan’s death a
terrible example—in decreeing that the sentence should
be carried out, against all the dictates of decent feeling,
in front of his own confiscated house, to make that death
a kind of show as well. But the more publicity given to so
callous and unscrupulous an action, the longer it was
likely to be remembered—against its author; and the
impression might not be what Bonaparte designed. The
hope of such a result was partly what Gaston de Trélan was
laying down his life for. Already, as he knew, there was
no small clamour and protest in Paris over his probable
fate, so that the added affront of this morning did but make
dying, after all, the more worth while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The short miles had slipped past. Here already, by the
slackening pace, was the turn off the Saint-Germain road.
Nearly ten years.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The carriage, swaying a little,
swung round at right angles into the way lined with gaunt
<span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span>
poplars, where the frozen puddles crackled under hoofs
and wheels—the last stage but one of the journey that was
bearing him away from all he loved. No! “Death could
never take you from me!” <span class='it'>Et expecto resurrectionem
mortuorum et vitam venturi saeculi.</span> Crossing himself, he
began silently to recite his act of contrition.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>And in a few moments more, the faint winter sun glinting
on its majolica, came Mirabel—Mirabel with the barrier
removed, and some hundreds of troops drawn up in front of
it on the frostbound gravel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer of hussars, raising his head, saw his companion
holding out to him, with a little smile, the lettercase he had
drawn from his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad, after all,” said the last Duc de Trélan quietly,
“that it should be <span class='it'>here</span>.”
<span class='pageno' title='421' id='Page_421'></span></p>

<h2 id='b4c12'>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>FOR SOME THE WORLD IS EMPTY</h3>

<h3>(1)</h3>

<p class='noindent'>It was Hyde de Neuville, half beside himself with grief and
fury, who brought the Comte de Brencourt the news,
which at ten o’clock the young conspirator had only just
heard, and which he could hardly believe. Yet there was
no doubt about its truth. And someone must break it to
the Duchesse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But not, surely, the stunned and horrified man to whom
this announcement had just been made. He stood frozen,
in his room at the little <span class='it'>hôtel garni</span>, repeating with a stammering
tongue, “Dead!—dead! shot this morning! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
there is some mistake .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish there were!” cried Hyde de Neuville passionately.
“I wish to God there were! I wish we had tried
for last night—why were we such fools as to delay? I
do not yet know whether this morning’s work was prompted
by design, or just by evil chance. And the Duchesse——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t suggest that I shall tell her!” cried the Comte
wildly. “De Neuville, for pity’s sake——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I must not lose a moment in going to Bertin and
the others,” said the young man. “We may all find ourselves
in prison before nightfall—and to no purpose.
Besides, I am a stranger to her; you an old acquaintance—the
Duc’s late chief of staff. You are the man, Comte.
Tell her the whole plan has failed—tell her her husband is
suddenly taken ill—tell her anything to soften the blow!”
And he was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte sank down and buried his head in his arms.
“I told her that he was dead, once. Now it is true—now
it is true!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not do it. He must find someone else. Roland—he
would break the news best, if he could get hold of him.
O God, to think he had once wished this, had lied for it,
had tried to bring it about with his own hand! And—shot
<span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span>
at Mirabel! The idea was profoundly shocking to him
even in the midst of the shock of the execution itself. He
seemed to recall a hateful precedent for it, for he remembered
the young Prince de Talmont, captured in the
Vendean war and shot in front of the castle of Laval,
which had belonged to his family for nine centuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was the time? Suppose Mme de Trélan were to
go to the Temple this morning! “The Duc is gone,
Madame la Duchesse; he has driven out to his château of
Mirabel. Will Madame follow?” Why did he see the
Temple as it had once been, a princely residence, and why
did he imagine that dialogue? He must be going mad.
She would not go there to-day; the order was for yesterday.
Yesterday she had seen him; and did not know she should
see him no more in life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Or stay, suppose Valentine had taken a fancy to visit
Mirabel this morning with Roland. It was most unlikely
that she would do such a thing; yet his distracted mind
showed him the Duchesse and Roland arriving there and
finding God knew what—soldiers, a crowd, and in front
of the great façade——</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt sprang up. That wholly baseless
picture decided him. He could not let her run that dreadful
risk. Oblivious of the fact that, long before she got to
Mirabel, if ever she went, she must meet the tidings of what
had taken place there, he crammed on his hat, and without
a redingote, despite the cold, rushed out in the direction of
the Rue de Seine.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“No, M. de Céligny has gone out,” replied Suzon’s servant.
“Mme de Trélan is within.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His last hope was vanished then. He never thought of
Mme Tessier. There was no help for it. Far rather would
he have been in the dead man’s place at Mirabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was only just in time, apparently, for the first thing
that he saw on being ushered into Mme Tessier’s parlour
was Valentine’s hat and gloves on the table. And she,
standing by the hearth, had her cloak on already—a grey
cloak with grey fur at the throat, in which he would always
see her now to the end of the world. He contrived, he
knew not how, to get across the room and to kiss her hand
before she noticed anything unusual.
<span class='pageno' title='423' id='Page_423'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad I had not gone out, Monsieur de Brencourt,”
she said in an ordinary tone, such as she had managed to
preserve nearly all the time in these days of strain. “I
was only waiting for Roland to return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she saw his face and said, quite quietly, “I
am afraid you bring some bad news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not good.” His voice—he heard it himself—was
the voice of a stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The plan has miscarried somehow, Comte—you have
come to tell me that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent his head. “Yes. Yes, Madame. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. came
to tell you that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pause. Slowly, slowly the colour faded in the face over
the grey fur collar that he would see to the end of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will not be carried out to-night, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“<span class='it'>Nor any other night.</span>”) No, he lacked courage to say
that yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Madame. It .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it has proved impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This cloak is too hot,” said Valentine de Trélan suddenly.
She unfastened the collar. “Perhaps I will not
go out after all.” She made as if she were going to throw
it off, then sat down instead in the armchair by the fire.
“But time is precious, Monsieur de Brencourt,” she said,
looking at him fixedly—he could feel that, though he
could not meet her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, trembling, and very low, “time is of no
value now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But either she had not heard, or she did not understand.
He could see that; so he tried again, and got out more.
“Madame, I must tell you that the time for this plan is
past for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt the impact of these words on her mind, yet he
felt also that she was gathering herself up in spirit
either to resist their meaning or to infuse fresh will
into him. He saw her hands clench themselves a little as
she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that has failed, then, you will make another, a better
plan, will you not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O, why would she not understand! He raised his eyes
at last in agony from her clenched hands to her face.
“Valentine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he said, and, had her life depended on
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span>
it, could get out no other word. His throat had closed
up. He turned away and hid his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire crackled like a burning house; outside in the
street a boy was whistling like a fife .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and yet it was so
still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last her voice came, and it sounded sick with horror.
“Monsieur de Brencourt, what—<span class='it'>what</span>, in God’s name, are
you trying to tell me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to go to the Temple to-day—not to go——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have taken him away?” she interrupted sharply,
her hands on the arms of the chair. “Transferred him to
another prison?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he turned and faced her, at last he got it out
in its entirety. “Yes, he is gone—but not to another
prison. He is gone where I wish I were gone too, before
I had to tell you. It is all over, Valentine, all over .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fell back in her chair. If only he might kneel and
kiss her feet, try—though he knew he could not—to comfort
her. But the memory of this scene’s parody, played
out falsely before, lay like a bitter flood between him and
her. This time it was true, his news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steps outside, thank God! Roland, perhaps, or Mme
Tessier, whom he had forgotten. He hurried to the door,
caught at the passerby—Suzon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go in to the Duchesse at once,” he said. “I have had
to bring her terrible news—I can bear no more. The Duc
was shot at Mirabel this morning. Go in, I say!” He
pushed her in.</p>

<h3>(2)</h3>

<p class='pindent'>On the very threshold, as he opened the door into the
street to escape, M. de Brencourt all but ran into an officer
of hussars. The officer was young, handsome, rigid, set
about the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Mme de Trélan lodge here?” he asked with a
foot on the doorstep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied the Comte. “Excuse me, Monsieur——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer barred the way. “Pardon me a moment.
I must see her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cannot,” retored de Brencourt, stopped despite
himself. “She cannot see anyone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She knows then!” said the young man, and there was
relief in his tone.
<span class='pageno' title='425' id='Page_425'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>And instantly, looking at the expression on his visage,
the Comte understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have just told her,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God for that,” returned the hussar. “But I
have a message to deliver—and I pray you, Monsieur, to
give it to her, as you have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. done the other thing. I
come straight from Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur,” replied the Comte hoarsely. “Once it was
prophesied to me that I should do this lady a service. I
did not know what it would be—now, I think I do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
have just rendered it, and not for the hope of heaven
would I go through the like again. You must give the
message yourself, if it was from .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>him</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no verbal message from .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the late Duc de
Trélan,” answered the young hussar, and as he paused
at the name and its qualification he suddenly brought his
heels together and saluted. And the Comte, for all his
pre-occupation with his own feelings, saw that his mouth
was twitching. “There is no verbal message,” he repeated,
“but I have two letters, and the Duc’s decoration. I
am charged, however, to say, that Mme de Trélan is at
liberty to go to Mirabel when and how she will, that her
privacy will be respected in every way, and that if she
wishes the body to be buried in the chapel there——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this the First Consul’s magnanimity!” flared out
the Comte. And, thinking he heard a sound behind him
in the house, and suddenly becoming conscious, too, that
all this was taking place on the doorstep, he seized hold
of the young officer’s hanging dolman. “Bring that cursed
uniform of yours inside!” he muttered, and, opening the
door of a little room close by, pushed the glittering and
jingling form inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once sheltered by a closed door the young Republican
turned on him almost savagely. “Do you think that you
are the only man heartbroken over this horrible business?”
he demanded. “Do you realise that I have had to help
carry it out—that it was I, at least, who commanded the
escort, that it was I who had to rouse M. de Trélan early
this morning with the news, had to drive with him from
Paris to Mirabel, had to sit my horse like a statue with
my sword drawn, as though I approved, while it was done—I
who have been one of Bonaparte’s aides-de-camp in
<span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>
Egypt and Syria, and have worshipped his very stirrup
leather .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and am going to throw up my commission
the moment I leave this house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no doubt of his emotion now; two tears were
running down his face. He could not have been more than
five and twenty. He raised a gauntleted hand and brushed
them away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, then, did you——” began M. de Brencourt in a
suddenly weary voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because if I had not commanded the escort someone
else would have done so. When I found I was detailed for
that duty, I thought I could at least ensure that M. de Trélan
had due respect shown him—and that I could, perhaps,
let him know before he died that there was, at any rate, one
soldier of the Republic who was ashamed of the deed. As
I intended to resign my commission immediately afterwards
there was nothing improper in that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and if I
went farther than I should perhaps have done when, on the
way to Mirabel, I offered to connive at his escape—well, the
Duc refused.” He paused, drew a long breath, and said,
“Afterwards I had my men carry him into Mirabel, into the
great hall there. We unbarred the big door for it. I had
the candlesticks fetched from the chapel also; strangely
enough, there were funeral candles already in them. If
Mme de Trélan goes, therefore, there is nothing she cannot
look upon; I have seen to that. His face is quite uninjured—I
would not even have it covered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte held out his hand to him. “If I could bring
myself really to believe that he is dead,” he said painfully,
“I would thank you in her name. But I cannot believe it—even
after telling her so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, God knows it’s true enough,” responded the
young hussar, passing his hand for a moment over his
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where was it carried out—this iniquity?” demanded
M. de Brencourt abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In front of one of the central towers, below which the
concierge used to live. It was the Duc’s own choice, when
he was asked if he had any preference; I do not know the
reason for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt did. He turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, even as he turned, the door of the little room opened,
<span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span>
and in came, not Roland, as he expected—but the Abbé
Chassin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You!” exclaimed the Comte, staring at him in astonishment.
They had not met since the memorable day in the
thicket by the road; moreover he thought the Abbé still
in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Travelstained, his eyes red-rimmed for lack of sleep, his
round face drawn and shadowed, the little priest looked
not only twenty years older, but as if the heart had gone out
of him for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have journeyed day and night since I heard he was
taken,” he said in a dulled voice. “I know now that I
am too late. My God, my God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you learn it? Have you seen Mme de
Trélan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet. Mme Tessier is with her. I heard it in the
streets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comte looked at him and was moved with compassion.
“I am sorry for that,” he said, gently for him, and
put his hand for a second on the dusty shoulder. Then he
bent and added in a low voice, “We should have saved him
this very evening if it had not been for this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young officer, who had been standing since the Abbé’s
entrance gazing at some objects which he had laid on the
table, here raised his head and addressed the newcomer.
“Then perhaps you, Monsieur, would give Mme la Duchesse
the message I bear—and give her these, too. I was trying
to persuade this gentleman to do it. It is not over fitting
for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?” asked M. Chassin, his face working
a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur commanded the escort,” replied the Comte
for him, “and has done everything that he could do, then
and since. He bears a message from the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
authorities that the Duchesse is free to go to Mirabel when
she pleases, and to do what she wishes about burial.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You tell her, Abbé. We have both had as much as we can
bear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think I can bear anything?” asked M.
Chassin in a half-choked voice, “I, who shall never see him
alive now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young hussar had noted the Comte’s method of
<span class='pageno' title='428' id='Page_428'></span>
address. “You are a priest, sir?” he enquired. “Then
perhaps this letter, directed to the Abbé Chassin, is for
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pierre was beside him in a moment, and saw what was
on the table. “O Gaston, my brother!” he exclaimed
brokenly, and knelt down there, covering his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Brother!</span>” ejaculated the Comte under his breath.
Then he understood. It explained many things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This order that he wore is not hurt,” murmured the
young hussar almost to himself, “although——” He did
not finish, but lifted a fold of the handkerchief, and revealed
the cross of white and gold with its red heart. “M. de
Trélan particularly wished the Duchesse to have it.” He
relapsed into silence again, looking down at it, and M. de
Brencourt stood looking at it too—save those two letters
in the firm hand-writing which he knew so well, all that was
left of the leader he had admired, and hated, and schemed
against—and tried to save.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Absolve, O Lord, the soul of Thy servant</span>,” prayed the
Abbé in the silence, “<span class='it'>that though dead to the world he may
live to Thee, and whatsoever he hath done amiss in his human
conversation, through the weakness of the flesh, do Thou
by the pardon of Thy most merciful loving-kindness wipe
away</span>.” He rose to his feet, took up the letter addressed
to him, kissed it, and put it in his pocket. “This, I understand,”
he said to the hussar, touching the cross, “is for
Mme de Trélan, as well as the letter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will do my commission then, Monsieur l’Abbé?”
asked the young man, his face haggard with strain and
entreaty. “I thank you from my heart! As for me, I
have business of my own now.” And he picked up his
shako.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moment,” said M. Chassin. “I fancy that when
I came in you were telling this gentleman some details
about—the end. The Duchesse may some day wish to
hear them; and I wish to know now, both as M. le Duc’s
foster-brother and a priest.—Did they let him have a
priest this morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young captain sedulously fingered the cords that
went round his headgear. “He asked for one, but none
could be found in the time.” He hesitated, and then broke
out—“If I might tell you the rest another day, Monsieur
<span class='pageno' title='429' id='Page_429'></span>
l’Abbé; I engage to do so. But just now the whole affair
is so horrible to me—no, not the actual execution, for
any one more nobly and simply composed than M. de Trélan
it is impossible to imagine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the one man at Mirabel
this morning who had no cause for shame. Moreover since
there was, mercifully, no bungling, he could scarcely have
suffered—shot, as he was, through the heart. I was not
the only soldier there who envied him so fine an end
before so many witnesses. (There were generals present;
Lannes and Murat, and Marmont, too, I think.) But the
treachery of it! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gentlemen, your cause has sustained
a great loss, but Bonaparte’s honour has sustained a
greater!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the Comte, “and if M. de Trélan had cared
less for that cause for which he died, he might very conceivably
have kept his life—but that, I expect, is not
generally known. I intend that it shall be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?” exclaimed the Abbé. “He refused a
pardon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He refused to ask for one,” returned the Comte, and
explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, my brother, I recognise you there!” said Pierre
softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet it is not a thing that the Duchesse ought to know,”
added M. de Brencourt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not know it!” exclaimed the young hussar. “Why,
to die like that is more than fine—it is glorious! It
seems a pity that she should be ignorant of it. <span class='it'>I</span> shall
remember .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Farewell, gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned towards the door, and took one step in its
direction, but no more. For it was open, and Mme de
Trélan herself stood on the threshold. None of them,
absorbed, had known it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt put his hand over his mouth. God
grant she had not heard! She gave no sign of it. Her
eyes were on the young Republican.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You come from .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mirabel, I think, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Madame. I have brought you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. these.”
He indicated the letter and the decoration on the table, but
made no motion to give them to her, and she did not take
them. Yet she looked at them as though she saw nothing
else. And the Abbé was kissing her hand before she seemed
<span class='pageno' title='430' id='Page_430'></span>
to realise that he was there, nor did she show any surprise at
his presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in a moment or two she lifted her eyes to the young
officer again, and from her look it seemed as if, with the
strange, exalted sight that comes sometimes with the
stroke of a grief that no words can fathom, she saw something
now of the tragedy of his soul on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you, sir, for these,” she said gently. “My
husband has a higher honour now, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young hussar bent his head till his looped-up tresses
of plaited hair fell on his breast. “Yes, Madame.” He
bowed profoundly, and went once more towards the door;
then, inspired perhaps by that vision of measureless sorrow
and courage before him, turned and said, “Madame, I
have been present at the death of a hero. I wish mine
might be like it!” And—only a young captain of hussars,
but the material of which the conqueror’s marshals
were made—he saluted and went out, to lay aside, with
his broken belief, all his dreams of glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he was gone, M. Chassin took the letter and the
cross in its handkerchief, and put them into Valentine’s
hands. M. de Brencourt looked out of the window. He
did not hear what they said to each other, but he
supposed that the priest was giving her the message about
Mirabel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was thawing outside. People were going to and fro
as usual.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Who would have thought the world would
seem so empty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine’s voice startled him. “Monsieur de Brencourt,
would you have the goodness to procure me a carriage? I am going
at once to Mirabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned round. “Not alone, Madame, surely!”
For she stood there alone now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, M. l’Abbé will go with me.—But first, tell me of
what you were speaking when I came in. I heard the
word <span class='it'>pardon</span>; was there ever talk of such a thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rent with compassion, he looked at her and did not
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard what that young man said,” she went on with
extraordinary steadiness, “that it was a pity I should not
know. Tell me, I implore you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew too much already! Useless to try to keep it
<span class='pageno' title='431' id='Page_431'></span>
from her now, and dreadful to combat her wishes at this
moment. And, not yet having seen Roland since yesterday
afternoon, the Comte had received no direct prohibition;
it was only his own consideration for her which recommended
silence. So he told her the truth. She covered
her face; and once again he left her.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell Roland, when he comes, to follow us to
Mirabel?” said the Abbé to him some half-hour later,
before entering the carriage after Mme de Trélan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Brencourt bowed his head. “And I?” he said
in a low voice, “If I might—if I dared think——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchesse turned hers and answered without hesitation.
“Come with Roland—<span class='it'>friend</span>!”
<span class='pageno' title='432' id='Page_432'></span></p>

<h2 id='b4c13'>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>TO THE UTTERMOST</h3>

<p class='noindent'>The Abbé Chassin, who lived to be a very old man, left
among his papers a full record of most of the events connected
with the death of the Duc de Trélan, but no word
of that short drive with Mme de Trélan from Paris to
Mirabel. Presumably he could not write of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Valentine was quite calm. She leant back nearly
all the way with her eyes closed, an image of marble in her
grey cloak. Her hands were clasped in her lap; Pierre
thought that she, like himself, was praying, but he was not
sure. From him, at intervals, scraps of the <span class='it'>De Profundis</span>
broke aloud, and he did not know it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>Domine exaudi
vocem meam</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>Quia apud te propitiatio est</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>speravit
anima mea in Domino</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Underneath it all was the
thought that their carriage wheels, once Paris was behind
them, were on the very track of Gaston’s, and that they
were passing over again, at so short an interval, his <span class='it'>via
dolorosa</span>. But well he knew that his had been nothing to
his wife’s, now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was not that the final swordstroke, too—that bitter and
glorious knowledge which was to have been kept from her?
He was sure that Gaston had not meant her to learn it.
And yet, after all, perhaps it fell at this hour on a heart
already numbed by shock, and she could better bear it
to-day than to-morrow. To have known it yesterday,
when her husband was still on earth—that would have been
intolerable. But she had said so little, seemed set on so
high a pinnacle of loss, that he could only look at her, and
conjecture, and pray. And in his own heart the sword
turned also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last they left the road to Saint-Germain. The
poplars passed one by one, those poplars under which Mme
Vidal had walked last spring to take up her post. Mud
splashed from the wheels; the puddles were melted since
<span class='pageno' title='433' id='Page_433'></span>
this morning. The carriage slackened, then, turning,
drove through the empty space between the gateposts
with their mutilated lions. But Mirabel bore little trace of
what had taken place there four or five hours ago, save that
the barrier was entirely removed, and the gravel scored by
the passage of troops. And there were certain marks
on the base of one of the towers; but these were invisible
at a distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drew up before the great steps. The priest got out
and assisted Mme de Trélan to alight. The heavy door
at the top, barred for so many years, stood wide open, and
on either side of it was stationed a hussar with drawn sabre.
At least then, ran his thought, the butchers have some
proper feeling; they do not intend the curious to pass that
door .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless, perhaps, it were that young captain’s
doing only. He offered his arm. But Valentine refused
it. “I would rather go quite alone,” she said gently. “If
you would wait here till I summon you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or till the
others come .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not gainsay her. So once more he, too, stood
in front of Mirabel, and suddenly realised with intensity
the part that Mirabel’s treasure—yielded moreover to <span class='it'>his</span>
hands—had played in these two lives. It had made
possible Gaston de Trélan’s short-lived success in Finistère,
and had thereby brought him fame—and death. It had
lifted his burden from him, and joined him and Valentine
in a union such as they had never known .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but only
to part them. The colonnades wavered for a moment as
all this beat upon the priest’s brain. Then he thought of
nothing else but what was before his eyes—the figure of
Mme de Trélan going up those wide, neglected steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not know, nor did Valentine till she came to
them, that across their discoloured marble trailed, in
places, another and a deeper discolouration. She had
reached the sixth or seventh of the twelve before its meaning
penetrated to her consciousness. She stopped, drawing
a long breath; then went slowly on again, looking at it.
But when she came to the tenth step Pierre Chassin,
watching from below, saw her sink on her knees, and
thought her strength was failing her. It was not so.
Bending forward, as on the ascent of some great altar,
the Duchesse de Trélan deliberately stooped and kissed,
<span class='pageno' title='434' id='Page_434'></span>
on the topmost step of all, one of the little splashes, dull
now, and dry, which marked her husband’s return to his
house of Mirabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she rose, and went also, between the guards,
through the open door, and into the Salle Verte.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>But here, in the long, pillared room, there were no signs
of anything like that ineffaceable witness upon the steps.
Only, an island of light in its vastness, a pale island in the
winter’s day, the tall candlesticks from the chapel, with
tapers burning in them, and, on the ground between,
straight and still, the sovereign presence there—Gaston.
Had there been rivers of blood, disfigurement, horrors,
they would not have stopped her for a moment; and,
come as she was to the end of the world where the great
sea washes in, she saw nothing but beauty and an unimagined
splendour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a second, indeed, those four spires tipped with flame
seemed a strange distance off, and, measured even by steps,
the way was long down the great, silent room of gilt and
marble, under the gaze of the painted Olympus of the
ceiling, which had looked on many scenes, but never on
the counterpart of this. Yet, with no remembrance of
having traversed it, she was there beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lay his full length, his head hardly raised on the
rolled-up military cloak which pillowed it, and he had
for a pall the strip of ancient tapestry from the sallette.
The worn fabric covered his body from throat to feet, but
over its faded imagery his hands were folded lightly on his
breast, the fingertips just crossing each other. His head
was turned a very little towards the door by which she had
entered, as if expecting her; a faint gleam of gold at his
side showed an inch or two of the fringe of his scarf—her
scarf—escaping from beneath the shrouding tapestry.
He did not now look more than five-and-forty, and, except
that he was mortally pale, he might have been asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valentine had no consciousness of death in presence
of this incarnation of dignity and repose. He had never
seemed more alive, or closer to her. Slowly she knelt
down by him; slowly, and without a tremor, she kissed
him on the mouth. For her there were no more fever-fits
of suspense, nor ever would be again.
<span class='pageno' title='435' id='Page_435'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she contemplated him, lying there like a victor.
This was his return to the house he had so lightly quitted—a
triumphal return, she could feel it no otherwise. He
had in death the same air of dominating his surroundings
that had been his in life, but with a serenity added which
it was hard to believe a violent end had given him. And
whence had he that air of absorption in some grave happiness
of his own? She knew. She had known this long
while—was it an hour? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was written too, perhaps,
in this letter. For here, alone with Gaston in this narrow
house of light, was the place to read his last message.
When she broke the seal of the letter a tiny packet slipped
out on to the hands which had put it there. Valentine
let it lie; what need for haste?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>There is not time</span>,” she read, “<span class='it'>there is not time to ask
you to come to me, Valentine, beloved, and perhaps it is best.
Indeed I did not intentionally deceive you yesterday when I
said that I should be allowed to see you again. The plan
has not failed; but it will never be put to the test now, and
perhaps that is best too.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I think you know, my dearest, that I look upon the perfidy
with which my life is taken from me as an opportunity which
I would not forego—though I tried not to put it to you too
directly yesterday when the issue was still in doubt. That
life itself is little enough to give, God knows, but at least it
is more than I should have been able to give had I been killed
in Brittany, where all we tried to do by the sword has proved
so vain. For to fall like this means immortal shame to the
conqueror, and you will see, Valentine, that the blot of the
violated safe-conduct and its sequel will not easily or soon be
washed from Bonaparte’s reputation, whatever lustre the
future may add to it; and so I like to think that my death
will do more for the cause than my life could ever have done.
And if my sword is broken, it is not taken from me. It is
not I who have regrets on the score of treachery. I have
my chance thereby—and you would surely be the last to stay
me. For once, Valentine, you gave me leave to die!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The regret I have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O my darling, is there need to
name it? Yet you said, that last night at La Vergne,
that we should never know any happiness over the sea
greater than that which we have had, so briefly but so
wonderfully, this autumn. It is true, dearest, true a
thousand times. We shall not now grow old together, that
is all.</span>
<span class='pageno' title='436' id='Page_436'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I do not presume to dictate to you what you should do until
we meet again. You will know best. The Abbé is aware
of my dispositions for your future. They are safely in
London; he will tell you of them when he returns. I wish
I could have seen him again; I have written him a few
lines—poor acknowledgment of what he has been to me. I
commend Roland to him, but most of all to you, you being
what you are. For him, too, Pierre knows my wishes. And I
ask de Brencourt’s pardon once more for what I said to him
at La Vergne when he tried to warn me. He has taken the
best revenge.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>But, Valentine, I do not ask your pardon again for all
the past, for that would be to doubt you—a thing impossible.
To my last breath this morning I shall have you in my heart—and
feel you in my arms, perhaps, as on the shore that day
in Finistère, when it was you who wished to die because we
were so happy. You see, therefore, beloved, how small a
thing it is, if one can do it cheerfully—as I do.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I have not much more time. Old Bernard has gone to
find a priest, but I do not somehow think he will be successful.
If I must depart unshriven you will pray best for me, my heart
of hearts, for you know all the worst of me. For I desire
to die as I have not always lived, in the Catholic faith, the
servant of the King of France, and your most unworthy
lover.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was dated that morning at a little before seven o’clock,
and signed with his full name, Gaston-Henri-Hippolyte-Gabriel-Eléonor
de Saint-Chamans, and with all his
titles.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The letter fell from Valentine’s hands. No mention
here of the pardon he had spurned—no mention, for her
sake. Ah, how much better she understood yesterday
now. “You tried to keep it from me,” she whispered,
“but I know your secret, O my knight without stain!
I know why you look like that! ‘<span class='it'>If one can do it cheerfully—as
I do.</span>’ If you could do it, surely I can bear the knowledge
of it!” And she clasped her hands in acceptance
above the piece of flotsam from other years that covered
<span class='pageno' title='437' id='Page_437'></span>
him like a banner, whereon still lingered fragments of
warriors and guidons and waves and battlemented towers,
and—unnoticed, perhaps, by the reverent and hostile
hands that spread it there—a border of the flower which
had sprung out of a soil of such past glories, the fleur-de-lys,
the symbol for which he had died. For she had very
clearly the conviction that she was speaking to him, that
she would often speak to him like this, as she might have
spoken yesterday, but with all the pain, the conflict of
wills, gone from their intercourse—that they would many
times talk together thus, and that she would tell him over
and over again, “My heart, my hero! you did well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
well!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she saw the little packet lying where it had fallen,
and took it up again. It was no more than a folded square
of paper with three words on it; but out of it—pale,
brittle, transparent as goldbeater’s skin, the stain at their
bases more deeply marked—floated the four pressed petals
of the yellow poppy she had once given him by the verge
of that full sea of joy. As before they fell—fell and
scattered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but not this time on the sand. Valentine’s
hand shook suddenly. Her presentiment of that day of
rapture had come true; they did typify that love of theirs,
so late in blooming, so miraculous in its perfect flower,
so soon cut short. Ghosts of their former loveliness, they
lay unstirred now on the quiet breast.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And there, too,
above her, as she knelt by Gaston treacherously slain, there
they were once more, wavering in the cold air, pallid in the
March daylight—four petals, each on a stem of wax,
significant and alive! Was this what the yellow sea-poppy
had foreshadowed—the petals of this encircling flower of
death, between which he lay so ivory-pale and would not
speak to her nor move? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he <span class='it'>was</span> dead; she had not understood. He could
not hear. Her head began to turn; a cold, slow terror rose
over her soul like a marsh-mist. The air seemed full of
flickering petals, flickering flames. As she had stretched
out her hands to Gaston that day by the menhirs, so now
she stretched them out again, but more blindly, in more
desperate need—and met his for the last time. And, cold
though they were and motionless, she clasped her own
round them, and, stooping, covered them with kisses, for
<span class='pageno' title='438' id='Page_438'></span>
they were still his hands .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the hands that yesterday,
about this time, warm and strong, were holding hers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When that thought touched her, Valentine’s composure
shattered to fragments. She could not bear it. It was
too much to ask of her, to approve this cruel heroism.
After so short a time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so short a time! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O, if
only she might follow Gaston now, if she might only lie
here cold beside him, where she was bowed in weeping
such as she had never known.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, that was not for
her; she saw instead a long road.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And even in her
anguish she found herself praying almost unconsciously—but
not for the accomplishment of that desire. In that
difficult prayer she seemed to drift a long way from the
Salle Verte .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even to be, once, on the threshold of a
strange region where grief and joy were in some mysterious
fashion fused into one awful beauty. And Gaston was
there with her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>When she came back she found in her hand the little piece
of paper that had enclosed the petals, on which she saw that
Gaston had written, written recently, three words, no more.
And they were the motto of his house; <span class='it'>Memini et permaneo</span>—‘I
remember and I remain .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to the end.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>They wonderfully steadied her; they seemed the most
direct message from those closed, serene and half-smiling
lips. And in this border country between the four candle-flames,
where her desire was accomplished and her heart
broken with its accomplishment, she saw clearly—and
would never quite lose the vision—the marvellous and
splendid thing that had come to them after those barren
years: to both a great love, to her a great sorrow, and to
him that noble end which even the foe had envied him—the
opportunity, in a shaken time, of proving his fidelity
to the uttermost, the supreme honour of choosing death
rather than belittle the cause he served.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, all, all that she had longed for him to show himself
lay here between the candles; and with it their love, safe
for ever. And very gently Valentine de Trélan gathered
up from their restingplace the almost bodiless petals
of the yellow poppy which were thus given back to
her, and held them a moment in the curve of her
hand. They seemed to mean, now, even more than they
<span class='pageno' title='439' id='Page_439'></span>
had meant that day, since they had lain on the heart which,
in making so great a sacrifice, asked of her a courage as
great, a fortitude longer drawn. Yet it was a crown that
she would carry—sharp, but royal. She looked at the
composed and beautiful head on the soldier’s cloak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am <span class='it'>his</span> wife,” she said to herself, “—<span class='it'>his</span> widow!”</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
